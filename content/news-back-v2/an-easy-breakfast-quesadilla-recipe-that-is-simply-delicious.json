Caramelize your broccoli.</strong></p>\n<p>Heat a small amount of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Place your chopped broccoli florets in the pan. If your broccoli is freshly washed, be careful when you place them in the pan; the combination of oil and water can cause a hot, sizzling mess! Make sure to stir the broccoli constantly to prevent it from burning.</p>\n<p>Your finished product should be bright green broccoli with caramelized edges. Sprinkle with some salt and pepper and set your broccoli aside.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Scramble your eggs.</strong></p>\n<p>Bring a small pan to medium heat and add some olive oil, or reuse the same pan that cooked the broccoli. Break a few Chino Valley Ranchers eggs into a bowl and whisk them until you have a fluffy scramble. Once your pan is hot, pour your scramble in and mix around until the consistency is no longer runny.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Assemble your quesadilla!</strong></p>\n<p>Place your tortillas on a plate and evenly spread out the shredded mozzarella cheese. Top each tortilla shell with equal amounts of scrambled eggs and broccoli.</p>\n<p>The heat from the eggs will help melt the cheese! There you have it – a delicious and healthy twist on a breakfast favorite!</p>\n<p>To learn more about our products, please <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">contact us</a> today!</p>\n"}
