A hot start will not affect how well the eggs cook, but instead will give you an easier peel.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #2: Lower the heat.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the eggs are in, lower the heat so that the water is gently simmering. Boil the eggs for 13 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #3: Make an ice bath.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the eggs are done boiling, drop them into an ice bath for five minutes. After five minutes, the eggs will have cooled down and will be much easier to peel.</span></p>\n<p>Now that you’ve learned the secret to easy-to-peel eggs, here are a few egg sandwich recipes to try out:</p>\n<p><b>Open-Faced Avocado and Egg Toast</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this recipe, you’ll need two thick slices of multigrain toast, one avocado, one teaspoon of lemon juice, one teaspoon of olive oil, ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes and ¼ teaspoon sea salt.</span></p>\n<p>Start by toasting the bread slices and cutting, pitting and removing the avocado from the peel.
