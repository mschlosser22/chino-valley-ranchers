Rather than sweet, she opted for savory with her Rosemary &amp; Thyme Waffles. This recipe combines Chino Valley Ranchers’ Organic Omega-3 Soy Free Eggs with other simple ingredients and are free of gluten, dairy, nuts, soy, corn and added sugar. “Eating organic eggs is one of the best things you can do for your body,” said Heib. “They are one of nature’s true superfoods!”</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">As a stay-at-home mom with two young boys, Heib strongly believes in balancing her lifestyle with fitness and healthy cooking, which is why she prefers using organic and nutritious ingredients in her breakfast recipes. “All simple, healthy ingredients fuel me through my morning workout, running errands and chasing the kids around,” said Heib. “It’s important to me to fuel my body with foods such as organic eggs, high-quality protein/meats and a huge variety of vegetables.”</p>\n<p class=\"responsiveNews\">Be sure to check out her <a href=\"https://realfoodrabbit.com/2017/12/19/rosemary-thyme-waffles/\">Rosemary &amp; Thyme Waffle recipe</a>!</p>\n"}
