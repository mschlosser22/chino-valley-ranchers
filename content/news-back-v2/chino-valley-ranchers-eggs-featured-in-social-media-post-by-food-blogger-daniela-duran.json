Organic and free-range eggs produced by third-generation family-owned and operated Chino Valley Ranchers are popular among many bloggers and social media influencers in the health, wellness, and food markets.</span><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Instagram post, Duran says eggs were a staple of her Whole 30 diet, a 30-day program that requires eliminating sugar, alcohol, grains, legumes, dairy, baked goods, and other ingredients present in processed foods and beverages. She says she chooses “to buy certified humane and pasture raised whenever possible because that means the hens were free to roam outside instead of being kept in a confined space.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers, Chris Nichols, says, “Every day at Chino Valley Ranchers we are motivated by our commitment to quality, integrity, and humane and sustainable practices. Every time someone purchases our eggs or creates a recipe featuring Chino Valley Ranchers eggs, we feel double the support and empowerment to continue following our passion for healthy and sustainable living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniela Duran lives in Huntington Beach, CA and created her blog, And A Pinch Of Love, to “help create a world where everyone wakes up every day, feeling empowered, healthy (both physically and mentally), confident, and filled with energy. I want to continue learning and sharing the information I receive, in order to make And A Pinch Of Love a place where we can all grow in the world of health and wellness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the full Instagram post, visit </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Buox__wAzPy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.instagram.com/p/Buox__wAzPy/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit Dani Duran’s blog for more recipes and wellness tips </span><a href=\"http://andapinchoflove.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://andapinchoflove.com</span></a></p>\n"}
