How long do eggs stay good for? </strong></p>\n<p>Egg cartons typically have a “sell by” date stamped on them. According to the American Egg Board, eggs kept in their shell can stay good for two to three weeks past their sell by date, so long as they remain uncooked and refrigerated the entire time. Any time past that, you’d be putting your health at risk by eating them.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do eggs need to be refrigerated?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, refrigerating your eggs is a must. For every day an egg is not refrigerated, the egg will age one week. For example, an egg left out for two days would be the same as a two-week old egg. On top of that, don’t store the eggs on the refrigerator door, as it is the warmest place in the refrigerator. This location also rattles the eggs when the door opens and closes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the difference between a brown egg and a white egg?</strong></p>\n<p>There is actually no taste or nutritional difference between a white and brown egg. The difference in color comes from the breed of hen, but other than the color, there is no distinct difference between the two eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is Omega-3?</strong></p>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a double bond at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. They are found in green, leafy plants, flax seeds and walnuts. Having an organic omega-3 egg means that the hens eat those types of foods as well.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How do eggs affect my cholesterol?</strong></p>\n<p>A Harvard Nurses Health Study (1980-1994) found that consuming eggs did not “measurably raise blood cholesterol levels or have an independent effect on heart disease risk.” The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also found that saturated fats were a major contributor to blood cholesterol levels, but dietary cholesterol had little effect on blood cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p>We hope that by answering these questions you are able to have a better understanding of eggs in general.
