What’s the best option for breakfast? Organic eggs, of course! Here are some quick and easy organic egg recipes.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Over easy, please.</strong> To make it extra simple, make sure the pan is clean the night before. In the morning, fumble to the kitchen, grab said pan and put it on the burner. Add some coconut oil (tip: refined coconut oil does not have a coconut flavor). Once it’s heated, crack 2-3 eggs into the pan. Cook to your liking. Enjoy with a piece of sprouted whole grain toast. Prep time: 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrumptiously Scrambled</strong>. This organic egg recipe is4 delicious! Again, to make things move quickly, make sure the pan is clean and ready to go the night before. Place pan on the stove and heat on medium for 1-2 minutes. Add butter or refined coconut oil. While pan and oil are heating, crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl. Add 2-3 tablespoons of coconut milk or organic whole cow’s milk. Stir with a fork until combined. Pour into pan and scramble! For an extra healthy breakfast, throw some broccoli, onions, and carrots into a food processor (to get them very finely chopped) and add to the egg mixture before cooking. Prep time 5-10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Make-ahead Casserole.</strong> To make mornings even easier, try this egg casserole. Make it over the weekend and enjoy all week. Ingredients: sweet potatoes, sausage, organic eggs, and milk. Chop 2-3 large sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Fry in a pan with butter or coconut oil. Season to taste. Remove from pan and place in a pre-greased 9&#215;13 casserole dish. Chop or crumble sausage (or bacon!) and place over sweet potatoes. Use however much you like. We think more is better! Next, crack 7-8 eggs into a bowl. Add some milk (either coconut or cow’s), salt, pepper, and garlic (or whatever seasoning you prefer), stir and pour over sausage and sweet potatoes. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until eggs are cooked through.</p>\n<p>Organic egg recipes are easy to make in the morning! At Chino Valley Ranchers, we harvest the best eggs.
