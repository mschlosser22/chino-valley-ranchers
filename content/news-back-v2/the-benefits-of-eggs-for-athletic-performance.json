In a typical egg yolk, you’ll find half the protein, antioxidants for eye and brain health and other crucial vitamins. But that’s not all &#8211; here are a few more nutritional aspects found in an egg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B-vitamins</strong>: Eggs contain vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12, which are all essential for keeping us energized by converting food into fuel.</li>\n<li><strong>Choline: </strong>A large egg contains 250mg of choline, a vitamin-like essential nutrient that’s similar to B-vitamins and is sometimes used by athletes to delay fatigue in endurance sports.</li>\n<li><strong>Magnesium: </strong>This essential mineral is the building block of virtually any cell. It’s linked to improved intra-workout recovery and better-quality sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Zinc: </strong>Healthy cell-division and metabolism depend on adequate amounts of zinc. It’s also essential for testosterone production, which aids in building lean muscle mass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Post-Workout Performance</strong></p>\n<p>While many of these vitamins are crucial for athletic performance, adequate protein intake is equally as important. This is more apparent in the recovery period, which is up to <a href=\"https://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.2010.3224?code=jospt-site\">two hours</a> post-exercise. Consuming protein during exercise or the recovery period leads to increased whole body and muscle protein synthesis as well as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3854183/\">improved nitrogen balance</a>. According to the results of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4831776/\">one study</a>, athletes should aim to consume about 0.27g/kg body weight in high-quality protein sources – such as eggs – during the recovery period for optimal performance.</p>\n<p>We at Chino Valley Ranchers know that our egg products pair well with other healthy ingredients to create a dish that’s loaded with performance benefits.
