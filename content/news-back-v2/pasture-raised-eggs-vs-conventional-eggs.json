Up until the mid-1900s, eggs were locally produced on small, family-owned farms. Advancements in technology and production practices eventually moved hens into cages and tight living quarters with little to no sunlight. </span><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the nutritional value of conventionally grown eggs began to decline, researchers began to look at ways to improve the quality of eggs. Over the past few years, pasture raised eggs have emerged as the quality standard for nutritious and healthy eggs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few reasons why you should consider purchasing Chino Valley Ranchers pasture raised eggs instead of conventional eggs.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nutritious And Yummy</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2010 Penn State study found that, compared to conventional hens, pasture raised chickens lay eggs that have twice as much vitamin E, more than double the total omega-3 fatty acids, and a healthier balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high omega fatty acid content contributes to the vibrant orange color of yolks in pasture raised eggs. Other possible reasons for this bright color is exposure to sunlight and a diet rich in nutritious seeds and plants, as well as slugs, worms, and insects.</span></p>\n<p><b>Terms to Look Out For</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When shopping for eggs, it’s important to understand the meaning of different terms and phrases frequently used to label eggs. While some terms, like “cage-free”, “free-range”, “organic”, and “pasture-raised” are regulated, others like “farm fresh” and “natural” are not. Visit the websites of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to learn more about production requirements for regulated terms.</span></p>\n<p><b>Why Choose Chino Valley Ranchers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chino Valley Ranchers pasture raised chickens are free to roam outdoors during the day in wide-open fields and eat grass, seed, bugs, and worms.
