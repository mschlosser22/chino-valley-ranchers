Begin with food prep.</strong></p>\n<p>Start off by preheating the oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Then, hard-boil your Chino Valley Rancher eggs in a pot. Once that is done, slice the eggs and place them to the side for later. Finally, take out a casserole-baking dish and butter its base so that the scalloped eggs do not stick to the bottom of the dish.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Get a skillet out. </strong></p>\n<p>Put a skillet on medium heat with melted better on it to cook the chopped onion to your liking. Then add flour, milk and cheese. Continue to stir until it is thick and the cheese is melted.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Fill up the casserole-baking dish.</strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended to sprinkle breadcrumbs at the very base of the dish. While this is not necessary, it does provide an extra bit of flavor and texture to the meal. Then, place the hard-boiled egg slices on top of the breadcrumbs. Pour the onion, milk and cheese mixture on top of the eggs and finish it off with a sprinkle of bacon and fried onions. If there is room, feel free to repeat with layers.</p>\n<p>Once the layers are finished, bake the dish in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes. Let it cool for a little while and then slice it accordingly to serve.</p>\n<p>To have this casserole taste its absolute best, be sure to use Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs.
