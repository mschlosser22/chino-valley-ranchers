It is estimated that over 48 million birds in 12 states either died or had to be euthanized. Luckily, as temperatures rose over the summer, the virus died off, but some experts predict that it might return with the cooler fall temperatures.<!--more--></p>\n<p>SEE ALSO: <a href=\"http://chinovalleyranchers.com/blog/report-bird-flu-leads-to-death-of-millions-of-hens/\">Bird Flu Leads to Death of Millions of Hens</a></p>\n<p>Many experts believe that factory farms are not sustainable, and there are many reasons why. First off, cage-free hens are healthier, thus their immune systems are better able to fight off disease. Factory raised hens are kept in tight living conditions, thus disease spreads like wildfire. While cage-free hens are allowed sunshine and warm backyard temperatures, which fights off disease, commercial poultry farms incubate disease due to the moist, dark, and crowded conditions.</p>\n<p>Still not convinced? Here are some reasons why cage-free eggs are a better choice.</p>\n<p>It’s better for the hens. Cage-free hens are happier and healthier; therefore they lay happy, healthy eggs. They are given the freedom to do what they love best: take dust baths, eat bugs and wild grasses, and run until their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>Cage-free farms are safer. Studies have shown that caged hens have a greater chance of being infected by Salmonella, which is the most common cause of food-related hospitalization in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>Cage-free eggs are better for everyone.
