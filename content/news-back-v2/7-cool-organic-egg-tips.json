We think it’s exciting, too. Not only are Chino Valley Ranchers’ laying hens fed an all-organic feed, but they’re also given the freedom to take dust baths, eat other things that come naturally to them (such as bugs), and peck about in the sunshine. They’re never confined to small cages, so you can rest assured that our organic eggs are the real deal. To make the most of your eggs, read on for some cool organic egg tips.<!--more--></p>\n<p>1. Use a plastic water bottle to separate the white and yolk. Many organic egg recipes call for just the whites or yolks, but separating them can be difficult if you don’t have the right tools. In this organic egg tip, simply crack your egg onto a plate. Next, take an empty water bottle, gently squeeze it, and suck the yolk up.</p>\n<p>2. Are your eggs still good? We have a great organic egg tip that’ll tell you right away. Place the egg in a cup of water. If it lays flat on its side, it’s good. If it stands straight up, it should be eaten or boiled right away. If it floats, toss it out.</p>\n<p>3. Make good use of all the parts. Most people know that eggshells can be composted or used as part of a fertilizer for plants, but did you know they can also be used to treat skin rashes and minor irritations? Place rinsed eggshells in a cup of apple cider vinegar until they are mostly dissolved. Use the concoction to soothe irritated skin.</p>\n<p>4. After you hard boil your eggs, don’t toss the water—it’s full of nutrient-rich calcium. Instead, use it to water plants. The calcium is especially beneficial for tomatoes, eggplant, herbs, and houseplants.</p>\n<p>5. This organic egg tips is off-beat, but it works. Add crushed eggshells to ground coffee before brewing. They’ll add a calcium boost to your brew (which works great because caffeine depletes the body of calcium), plus they’ll cut any bitter notes.</p>\n<p>6. Clean your kicks. Using the water bottle method, separate the egg white from the yolk. Gently rub the white onto your shoes and then wipe off with a damp cloth. The stickiness of the egg removes any dirt or grime while leaving behind a healthy-looking sheen.</p>\n<p>7. Make tempura paint. Using the egg yolk left over from your shoe cleaning session, put it in a small bowl and pierce it with a sharp knife. In a separate bowl, mix in some dried paint pigment with water to create a thick paste. Next, mix in the paste until you have your desired color. This paint cannot be stored, so only make enough for one project at a time.</p>\n<p>As you can see, all parts of an organic egg can be used around your home. Whether you need to give your plants a nutrient boost, add something new to your coffee, or make a new paint, these organic egg tips are sure to help.
