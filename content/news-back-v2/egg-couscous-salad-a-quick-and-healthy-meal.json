In a separate bowl, whisk together your Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs and add it to the broth. Make sure to stir them occasionally until they are set, for about a minute or so. Add in the couscous, cover the top and reduce the heat to a simmer. The couscous should be ready when it’s soaked up the liquid and is soft but still firm, about 10 minutes. When it’s done, remove it from the heat and set it aside.</li>\n<li><strong>Make the dressing<br />\n</strong>To make the dressing, whisk together 3-part olive oil, 1-part red wine vinegar, and ½-parts of lemon juice, dried basil, dried oregano, onion powder and garlic powder. Pour the dressing over the couscous so that everything is well-coated. Add in the chickpeas, tomatoes and sweet pepper, and garnish everything off with some parsley, salt and pepper.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a bolder flavor, leave your egg and couscous salad in the fridge to soak up the dressing. Be sure to serve it cold.</p>\n<p>Simple as that – a delicious dish perfect for any holiday gathering you may have coming up. Your salad will be fluffier, tastier, and full of protein all from the simple addition of eggs!</p>\n<p>Make sure to use organic, grass-fed eggs from Chino Valley Ranchers’, located at a <a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">store near you</a>.
