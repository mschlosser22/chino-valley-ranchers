The egg keto </span>fast is a short-term diet that requires eating mainly eggs, butter and cheese.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>The rules of an egg fast</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The egg fast was developed by health blogger Jimmy Moore in 2010 and is designed to help individuals break through weight loss plateaus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ketogenic diet is high in fat, low in carbs, and moderate in protein. This macronutrient combination helps the body enter the metabolic state of ketosis, which is when the body uses ketones for energy instead of glucose. </span><a href=\"https://perfectketo.com/what-are-ketones/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ketones</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are chemicals made in the liver, which are byproducts of the body burning fat for energy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few rules to follow during an egg fast:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat at least six whole, pasture-raised eggs per day as your main source of fat and protein.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consume one tablespoon of butter or healthy fat and one ounce of full-fat cheese per egg.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat one whole egg within 30 minutes of waking up.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat an egg-based meal every three to five hours.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t eat three hours before bedtime.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Benefits of an egg fast</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An egg fast can help individuals:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Reduce appetite</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An egg fast helps the body feel full because eggs are high in protein. A diet high in protein helps raise levels of hormones that stimulate a feeling of fullness and reduce the levels of hunger-promoting hormones.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Aid weight loss</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the egg fast is restrictive in regards to the foods that are allowed, a fasting individual’s daily calorie intake will naturally decrease. In addition to helping an individual lose fat, the keto diet can also help maintain muscle mass and improve levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Promote belly fat loss</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study of “adults following a ketogenic diet resulted in participants losing more total fat and belly fat than those on a low-fat diet — despite eating 300 more calories per day.” However, an individual’s fat loss will be dependent on multiple factors, including their starting weight, height, age, gender and total food intake. </span></p>\n"}
