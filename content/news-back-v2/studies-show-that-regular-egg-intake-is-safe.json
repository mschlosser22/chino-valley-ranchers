What we do know is that eggs are an excellent low-calorie way to get protein, vitamins, and minerals into your diet. One whole egg is just 70 calories and contains 13 essential vitamins and minerals. But, exactly how many eggs are safe to consume each day?<!--more--></p>\n<p>First, let’s take a look at the role of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a compound that is needed to make hormones, vitamin D, and certain substances that help you to digest your food. Your body makes cholesterol, but you also get a small amount from some of the foods you eat. It used to be thought that the cholesterol from your diet had a significant effect on the amount of cholesterol in your blood; however, that is no longer the case.</p>\n<p>Over the years, study after study, the role of dietary cholesterol has been researched. With consistent data showing minimal connection between dietary and plasma cholesterol, the long-standing limit on cholesterol intake was lifted with the release of the <a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/\">2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>. In 2016, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans states that it <em>no longer considers cholesterol to be a nutrient of concern</em>. Egg-enthusiasts, rejoice!</p>\n<p>But, what does this mean for the safety of daily egg consumption?</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health\">an article</a> by Harvard Medical School, consuming one, two or even three eggs per day is consistent with a healthy diet and is unlikely to have any significant impact on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. While it’s possible that eating more than three eggs per day could have health implications, overall diet quality is far more important to heart health than the number of eggs you eat each day.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we understand that eggs make up many diets, which is why we provide our hens with thriving environments to ensure that you receive nutrient-dense, organic eggs that taste delicious.
