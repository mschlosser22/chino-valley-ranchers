If the shell is not peeled just right, it will break into a million little pieces and take forever to remove.  At Chino Valley Ranchers, we have already discussed the best way to cook a hard-boiled egg. But once it has been cooked, how can it be easily peeled?<!--more--> One way to remove the shell quickly and efficiently is with these three easy steps.  A simple kitchen teaspoon is all that is needed!</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Tap the egg: Gently tap the bottom of the egg on a hard surface so it cracks just slightly. In this case, the bottom of the egg is the wider part, with the narrow top just opposite. Remove a small portion of the shell, including the thin skin-like layer just underneath.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Slide spoon under shell: Carefully slide a small spoon underneath the small area that was just cleared at the bottom of the egg, matching the curve of the spoon against the curve of the side of the egg. Wiggle the spoon gently up towards the top of the egg with the shell now on the outside of the spoon.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Turn slowly and peel: Once the spoon is completely underneath the shell, slowly rotate the egg around, peeling the shell with the spoon. When the shell is completely loose, lift it away from the egg. If it has been shelled properly, it should just fall away and leave a beautiful egg, ready for consumption! Any remaining pieces can be washed away under water.</p>\n<p>Peeling hard-boiled eggs can be tricky, but hopefully you’ll soon be a pro!
