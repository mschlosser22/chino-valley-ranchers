{"title":"Brown Eggs vs White Eggs: The Myths","slug":"brown-eggs-vs-white-eggs-the-myths","date":"2015-02-06T13:47:21","author":"Chino Valley Ranchers","content":"<p>You hear it all the time: brown eggs are better. They contain more nutrients, they’re better for you, they taste better. They’re more expensive, so they must be healthier. Right?</p>\n<p>Not necessarily. When it comes down to it, brown eggs and white eggs have one real difference: their color. So why do we consider white eggs to be worse for us? There are a few perpetuated myths that keep us thinking brown eggs are better.</p>\n<p>The myth: More expensive eggs mean the eggs must be healthier for us.</p>\n<p>The reality: Brown eggs cost more because the hens that lay brown eggs are larger and require more food. Hens that lay white eggs are smaller and require less money to maintain, so they are cheaper in stores.</p>\n<p>The myth: White eggs aren’t organic because they have been dyed.</p>\n<p>The reality: White eggs can absolutely be organic. What determines if the egg is white comes down to the hen. If the hen has a white ear lobe, they will lay white eggs. If their ear lobe is red, they will lay brown eggs. In fact, if you raise a white-lobed hen and a red-lobed hen on the exact same diet, the insides of the egg would be completely indistinguishable.</p>\n<p>The myth: Brown eggs have a thicker shell, which means it’s better.</p>\n<p>The reality: The thickness of the shell has nothing to do with the nutritional value and everything to do with the age of the hen. If the hen is older, the shell will be thinner. A younger hen will lay an egg with a thicker shell.</p>\n<p>The main way to differentiate eggs is not color. Instead, factors like organic vs. non-organic or cage-free vs. cage eggs are what really make a difference.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we pride ourselves on providing the best quality eggs for you and your family.
