Whether it’s a veg-a-fed, organic or nutri-fresh fertile egg, we at Chino Valley Ranchers offer a wide variety of egg options for our customers. One of our newer options we’ve recently added is the soy-free organic egg. Not sure what that is exactly? Here are some facts about soy-free organic eggs to help you get acquainted with them.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. These eggs are perfect for those who typically can’t eat eggs. </strong></p>\n<p>Oftentimes, those who are allergic to eggs are actually just allergic to the soy that is in the eggs, not the egg itself. Many customers have found that by eating soy-free eggs, they are able to easily consume and digest the eggs perfectly fine.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Hens producing soy-free eggs are on a special diet.</strong></p>\n<p>A typical diet for a hen producing regular eggs usually contains a good amount of soy. In order to produce an egg without soy, Chino Valley Ranchers knew that we’d have to switch up the hens’ diet. After working with a nutritionist and doing the proper research, we’ve found a mixture of organic grains and seeds that provide the nutrients the hen needs, while also leaving soy out of the eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Soy-free organic eggs contain more of Omega-3. </strong></p>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is supposed to be better on your heart and arteries over other types of fat. In fact, research has shown that Omega-3 fatty acids can oftentimes be attributed to lowering the risk of a stroke or heart attack. This is because this type of fatty acid lowers your chance for a blood clot in your arteries.</p>\n<p>It is clear that soy-free organic eggs have a lot to offer consumers.
