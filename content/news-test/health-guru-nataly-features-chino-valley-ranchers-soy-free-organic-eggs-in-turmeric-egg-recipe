Her recipe includes adding turmeric powder to a pot of boiling water prior to poaching. The result? Brightly colored and nutritious poached eggs, perfect for coupling with any breakfast items. “I love pairing the eggs with sprouted toast and arugula tossed in olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper, and avocado,” said Perez.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2264\" src=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers.png 800w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers-150x150.png 150w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers-300x300.png 300w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers-768x768.png 768w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chino-Valley-Ranchers-1024x1024.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" /></p>\n<p>As a fitness and health guru, Perez is committed to presenting daily, healthy recipes to her 42,000+ followers on Instagram.
