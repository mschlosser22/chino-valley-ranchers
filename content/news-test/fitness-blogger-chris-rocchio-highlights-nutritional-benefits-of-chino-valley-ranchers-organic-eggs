The one constant in all his posts is the passion for using organic eggs from pasture-raised chickens (otherwise known as “PR” eggs).</p>\n<p>“I constantly hear that people still don’t have options at their local stores to buy eggs from pasture-raised chickens, and therefore don’t get the extra nutrients and benefits they provide,” said Rocchio. “So, I’m always directing them online to source their proteins, and for eggs, I recommend Chino Valley Ranchers as a source.”</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://chrisrocchiofitness.wordpress.com/\">his site</a> and social media feeds, Rocchio regularly shares helpful tips for better fitness and healthier living to his 90,000+ followers. He enjoys sharing his personal fitness journey and teaching others how to optimize their lives based on what he’s learned over the years as a fitness expert.</p>\n<p>“It’s always good when you can go online and check the company’s practices for raising animals, and they do it right,” said Rocchio. “It’s not what you eat. It’s what you eat, ate.”</p>\n<p>Check out Rocchio’s egg-inspired Instagram post <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkahMbmnnL8/?taken-by=chris.rocchio_fit\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Chino Valley Ranchers, their chicken-raising practices and their all-organic eggs and egg products available, <a href=\"http://chinovalleyranchers.com/contact\">contact us</a> today!</p>\n"}
