Looking for some help achieving that summer body? The answer might be in a simple breakfast food: eggs. Eggs sometimes receive a bad reputation for being high in cholesterol, but this does not negate the other health benefits.<!--more--></p>\n<p>While there is certainly more to weight loss than eating eggs, some of the health aspects of eggs might be surprising.</p>\n<p>• Calorie Count: One large egg contains only 75 calories and less than half a gram of carbohydrates. It also provides 6 grams of protein, 13 essential vitamins (among which include vitamins A, D, B, phosphorus, and zinc). It will even provide your body with omega-3 fatty acids, which help keep your heart healthy!</p>\n<p>• Packed Protein: New studies are showing that high-protein foods create more satisfying meals. Protein is harder for the stomach to break down, which in turn keeps the body fuller, longer. One study found that those that ate an egg or two for breakfast ate 330 fewer calories throughout the day because they were full through the afternoon. This equated out to 65 percent more weight loss!</p>\n<p>• Fitness Fuel: Eggs give the body great energy to work out. Of course, a solid workout will also aid in the weight loss process, but eggs help build and repair muscles too. As weight loss progresses, protein helps build muscle while burning fat, so eggs are the perfect food!</p>\n<p>Eggs aide weight loss but cannot do the job alone. In order to get that body beach-ready, start the day with eggs but continue with healthy food and exercise. And as a reminder, adding huge amounts of cheese, salt, and cream to the eggs will completely refute their health benefits, so keep it as simple as possible! Hard-boiled eggs or veggie omelets are our recommendation!</p>\n<p>For more information on our organic eggs, give Chino Valley Ranchers a call today.</p>\n"}
