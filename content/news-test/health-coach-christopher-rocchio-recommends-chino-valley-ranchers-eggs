More nutritious &#8211; higher in vitamin A, E, and Omega-3’s, which means it’s better at lowering triglyceride levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continues, “I constantly hear that people still don’t have options at their local stores to buy eggs from pasture-raised chickens, and therefore don’t get the extra nutrients. So I’m always directing them online to source their proteins, and for eggs I recommend @chinovalleyranchers as a source. It’s always good when you can go online &amp; check the company’s practices for raising animals, and they do it right.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers, Chris Nichols, says, “For years, Chino Valley Ranchers has been the brand of choice for many chefs, health coaches, fitness gurus and individuals passionate about eating a healthy diet. We are proud to be a company that helps people make better food choices and live a healthier lifestyle.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On his Instagram profile and website, Health Coach Christopher Rocchio shares tips for healthy eating, recipes, and nutritional information.
