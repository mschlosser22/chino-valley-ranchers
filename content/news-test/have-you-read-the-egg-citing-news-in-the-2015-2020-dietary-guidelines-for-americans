So if you’re like us and have read the <a href=\"http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/\">2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, you know there’s good news when it comes to eating eggs. <!--more-->For starters, the guidelines remove a daily limit on dietary cholesterol, which includes the cholesterol found in eggs. Additionally, eggs have been labeled as affordable and accessible nutrient-rich sources of high-quality protein.</p>\n<p>These dietary guidelines provide three recommended patterns to follow, each of which includes eggs: Healthy American, Vegetarian, and Mediterranean Diets. Let’s explore the boundaries of each diet:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Mediterranean</strong> <strong>Diet</strong>: This diet has been featured in various studies for its heavy reliance on protein and veggies. Examples of an egg-based meal in this diet would be a turkey, kale frittata, like the one we created <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/try-our-turkey-kale-frittata-recipe/\">here</a>. This is a great way to get in a serving of vegetables and high-quality protein to start the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Healthy American</strong>: This diet focuses on consuming nutrient-dense food and lowering added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Ideally, people following this diet would consume mostly fruits and vegetables along with dairy, grain, and protein. Get your fix in with a serving of colorful vegetables and protein, like with our <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/youll-love-this-sweet-potato-veggie-scramble-recipe/\">Sweet Potato Veggie Scramble</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Vegetarian</strong>: Plant-based diets have been proven to have more health-promoting benefits than the average U.S. diet. A <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dietary-guidelines-remove-daily-limit-on-cholesterol-and-include-eggs-in-recommended-eating-patterns-300200901.html\">recent survey</a> conducted by the Egg Nutrition Center suggests that 82 percent of consumers did not believe that eggs are part of a plant-based diet. However, “plant-based” can include protein sources like eggs, too.
