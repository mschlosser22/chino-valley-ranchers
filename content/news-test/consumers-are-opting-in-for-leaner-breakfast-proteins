Though, over the years, the traditional American breakfast has made a dramatic shift. Consumers have gravitated toward protein-rich breakfast alternatives.<!--more--></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.smuckerawayfromhome.com/assets/pdf/Smuckers%20Breakfast%20Brief%20-%20Non-Meat%20Proteins.pdf\">survey</a> conducted by Technomic showed that 75 percent of people perceive foods high in protein as being healthier and 39 percent are willing to pay extra for it. This means that we’re starting to move away from red meat and pork, and instead are opting in for lean protein sources, like turkey, chicken and – you guessed it – eggs.</p>\n<p>Aside from being a valuable protein source, eggs are simple, convenient and delicious. Most restaurants have even added all-day breakfast options to account for the ongoing egg craze. One large egg contains <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/egg-facts/\">6 grams of protein</a>, which is a solid chunk of the daily requirement for an average adult. It’s no wonder why “putting an egg on it” is becoming more and more common.</p>\n<p>And it doesn’t stop there: the demand for egg whites has also increased. According to <a href=\"http://www.aeb.org/news-trends/incredible-breakfast-trends/simply-nutritious/leaning-toward-leaner-protein\">Datassential</a>, the number of restaurants that feature egg whites on their menus has risen 32 percent since 2009. As this demand continues to increase, more restaurants will be pushed to creatively expand their menus to provide healthful eating.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Nutritional Promise</strong></p>\n<p>Here at Chino Valley Ranchers, we understand the exact components that make up each and every egg we sell.
