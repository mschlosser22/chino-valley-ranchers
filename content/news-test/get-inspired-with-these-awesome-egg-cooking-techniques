Not only are they good for you, but you can serve them just about any way you’d like: scrambled, fried, sunny side up, etc. – the list goes on! With an endless amount of cooking techniques available at your disposal, we thought it’d be a good idea to point out a few you probably haven’t tried before.<!--more--> Take a look at these three awesome techniques before cooking your next delicious egg dish!</p>\n<p><strong>1. Shredded Eggs</strong></p>\n<p>Cheese is delicious, especially with eggs. But did you know that you can use eggs as a cheese substitute? This is especially good news for those who are lactose-intolerant! Just boil an egg<strong>,</strong> grate it, and sprinkle it over any meal where you would want cheese. It can add the subtle flavor and texture similar to cheese without the extra fat and calories – it’s a win-win for everyone!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Eggs in Clouds</strong></p>\n<p>If you like your Chino Valley Ranchers eggs sunny side up, you’ll love eggs in clouds! All you have to do is separate the egg whites from the yolk, beat the egg whites until they are stiff, and then form them into little cloud shapes that can hold the yoke. Bake them in a hot oven until the egg whites turn golden brown and the yolk is slightly set.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Sheet Pan Eggs</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s a new craze that’s spreading: sheet pan eggs. Just whisk your eggs<strong>, </strong>pour them into a greased pan, and bake them until they are set with no runny spots. They taste similar to scrambled eggs and frittatas, and they can be cut into squares for the perfect breakfast meal-prep.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to resort to scrambling and boiling when it comes to preparing your eggs. But we at Chino Valley Ranchers believe that you can change up your routine and enjoy a new way of preparing your eggs. It just requires a little inspiration, from our kitchen to yours.</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about how to incorporate eggs into your diet?
