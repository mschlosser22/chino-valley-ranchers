We have the answer, and a heavenly recipe to boot!<!--more--></p>\n<p>Though the origin cannot be attributed to one specific time, place, or person, it is something that has developed over the centuries. It appears as though the Ancient Romans were one of the first to start preparing stuffed eggs back in the 13th century. By the end of the 16th century, it was common practice to create deviled eggs as we know them today: boiling the egg, removing the yolk, combining the yolk with spices, and refilling the egg white. By the end of the 17th century, it was considered normal.</p>\n<p>By the 18th century, the name “Deviled Egg” came along. Back in the late 1700s, the term “deviled” described food that was boiled or highly seasoned. As the term evolved, it was more about spicy foods, likely comparing the heat of the food with the devil.</p>\n<p>So now that the history has been established, put it to good use!
