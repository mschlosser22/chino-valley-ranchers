Seasoning the water when making poached eggs.</p>\n<p></b>Adding salt to boiling water helps to break down foods like pasta and vegetables. But when you’re making poached eggs, you want to keep the egg whites together while they’re cooking. Add in the seasoning once the eggs are cooked.</p>\n<p><b>2. Using high heat.</p>\n<p></b>Even if you’re using a non-stick frying pan, never make scrambled eggs over high heat. Preheat the pan over medium heat and then reduce heat to medium-low once the eggs have been added in. A lower heat level helps cook the eggs more evenly and prevents burning or drying them out.</p>\n<p><b>3. Using the wrong pan.</p>\n<p></b>Only use a nonstick pan when preparing eggs. Consider dedicating a nonstick pan for making scrambled and fried eggs. This will help keep the pan in good condition and prevent them from becoming glued to the bottom.</p>\n<p><b>4. Cracking on the side of the pan or bowl.</p>\n<p></b>Cracking on the side of a pan or bowl can cause shell bits to fall into the raw egg and cause part of the egg to run on the outside rim of the pan. Instead, crack eggs on a flat surface.</p>\n<p><b>5. Not whisking enough.</p>\n<p></b>When making scrambled eggs and omelets, mix the eggs with a fork or whisk until there’s no white or clear strands left behind.</p>\n<p><b>6. Cracking the eggs directly into the water when making poached eggs.</p>\n<p></b>If you’re making poached eggs, crack them into small, shallow bowls. Then, slowly ease them into the water and avoid making a splash to help them keep their shape.</p>\n<p><b>7. Adding eggs to a cold pan.</p>\n<p></b>Whether you’re making scrambled eggs or an omelet, heat up the pan to a medium-hot temperature before adding in the eggs.</p>\n"}
