But over the years, more studies have emerged to support the importance of eggs in the diet. Specifically for athletes, eggs are an excellent source of protein and amino acids, which aid in recovery and makes them valuable to a post-workout diet.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Muscle Building and Recovery</strong></p>\n<p>Did you know eggs have a plethora of nutrients that benefit the body after a workout? The yolk is the source of various B vitamins and choline, which help delay muscle fatigue. These nutrients, combined with the amino acids also found in eggs, make them especially beneficial in resistance training and endurance sports because they help build muscle and restore glycogen.</p>\n<p>The yolk also contains antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin which boost eye, skin and overall health; something that is important for athletes and casual gym-goers alike. In addition to being high in protein, egg whites contain magnesium which helps improve recovery during workouts and contributes to better quality sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>All-Around Nutrition </strong></p>\n<p>Whole foods like eggs are much better to eat post-workout than supplements and engineered foods. Eggs have the added benefit of being an affordable way of adding versatility to healthy dishes.
