Keep the carton.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s common for some folks to throw away the egg carton and store their eggs in a caddy or in a separate bowl. Though this may look prettier, the original carton can help increase the shelf life of your eggs. By keeping your eggs in the carton, you can easily keep track of the expiration date and prevent them from absorbing strong odors from other foods in your fridge.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Set your fridge at an optimal temperature.</strong></p>\n<p>Your fridge’s temperature is key when it comes to preserving the freshness of your eggs. Cold temperatures (anything between 35°F and 40°F) can prevent the growth of most harmful bacteria. Also, make sure to store your eggs in the main body of the refrigerator to ensure that they’re exposed to a constant flow of cool air.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Store cracked-open eggs tightly.</strong></p>\n<p>Leftover raw egg whites and yolks should be put in airtight containers and stored in the refrigerator immediately. The trick to prevent yolks from drying out is to cover them with a bit of cold water. Once you’re ready to use them, just simply drain the water.</p>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your eggs are no longer fresh? The easiest way is by checking the date on your egg carton. Another way to check for freshness is to place the egg in a bowl of water: if it sinks, it’s still fresh; if it floats, it’s probably best to toss it out.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we preserve the freshness of our eggs by keeping a well-maintained, clean environment for our chickens and ensuring proper handling once the eggs are laid.
