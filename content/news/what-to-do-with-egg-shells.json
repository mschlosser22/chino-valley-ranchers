There are so many recipes we can make with eggs, from frittatas and muffins, to casseroles and deviled eggs, but what about the egg shells? You’d be surprised at the nutritional benefits of egg shells and their many uses.</p><p></p><p>Egg shells are rich in calcium, strontium, and fluorine — nutrients that support bone metabolism and stimulate cartilage growth. The anti-inflammatory effects of eggshells are another benefit being explored in various studies for their potential to treat joint connective tissue disorders, such as lupus, gout, arthritis, and back pain. In addition, eggshell powder may be used to support remineralization of the enamel in teeth, according to recent research.</p><p></p><p><strong>Composting</strong></p><p>The calcium and minerals found in egg shells will help break down soil to increase the availability of nutrients in your home garden. Be sure to crush the shells before placing them in the soil to speed up decomposition.</p><p></p><p><strong>Improve coffee flavor</strong></p><p>If putting egg shells in your coffee grounds sounds strange, rest assured there’s a good reason to do so. The alkaline levels of the egg shells help balance the acidity of coffee, creating a smoother and more mellow flavor.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rinse the uncooked shells with hot water and crush them, before adding them to coffee grounds. Typically one egg is enough for four cups of coffee.</p><p></p><p><strong>Face mask</strong></p><p>Use a mortar and pestle to crush a clean egg shell and whisk it into an egg white. Apply the mixture to the face and allow the mask to dry before removing. The protein in the egg white and shells will help tighten and rejuvenate the skin.</p><p></p><p><strong>Garden pest repellant</strong></p><p>The jagged edges of egg shells will repel slugs, snails, and cutworms, as well as cats who might want to use your garden as their personal litter box.</p><p></p><p><strong>Gardening</strong></p><p>Tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants will benefit from the extra calcium found in egg shells, as well as rose bushes and apple trees.
