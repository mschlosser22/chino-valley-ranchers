About 30% of the brain is composed of omega-3 fatty acids, which is used to build brain and nerve cells. These fats support learning, memory, slow age-related mental decline, and ward off depression. Research also suggests that eating fish regularly increases gray matter in the brain, which is a substance that contains nerve cells that control memory, decision making, and emotion.</p><p><br><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Coffee</strong></p><p>The caffeine and antioxidants contained in coffee help support brain health. Caffeine also delivers the following benefits:<br></p><ul><li><p>Increase alertness by blocking adenosine, a chemical messenger that causes drowsiness</p></li><li><p>Improve mood by boosting feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine</p></li><li><p>Sharpen concentration by improving attention and alertness</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Blueberries</strong></p><p>Blueberries contain anthocyanins, which is a group of plant compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Consuming blueberries helps reduce stress and inflammation, and improve communication between brain cells.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Pumpkin seeds</strong></p><p>Pumpkin seeds are rich in magnesium iron, zinc, and copper. These nutrients support nerve signaling, learning, memory, and brain function.</p><p><br><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Dark chocolate</strong></p><p>Chocolate with at least 70% cocoa contains flavonoids, caffeine, and antioxidants. Flavonoids are used by areas of the brain responsible for learning and memory, helping slow age-related mental decline.</p><p></p><p>Chocolate is also an effective mood booster, increasing positive feelings.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Nuts</strong></p><p>Eating nuts helps improve heart-health markers, which is linked to a healthy brain. One study showed that regular consumption of nuts is related to a lower risk of cognitive decline in older adults. The antioxidants, vitamin E, and healthy fats in nuts may explain the health benefits for the brain.</p><p><br><strong>7. Eggs</strong></p><p>Eggs are rich in vitamins B6 and B12, choline, and folate — nutrients tied to brain health. Choline is used to create a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine that helps regulate mood and memory. Research showed that higher intakes of choline is linked to better memory and mental function.</p><p><br>Folate and B12 help slow the progression of mental decline in adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&nbsp;</p>"}
