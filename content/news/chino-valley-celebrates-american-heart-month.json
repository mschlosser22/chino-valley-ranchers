Chino Valley Ranchers is excited to celebrate this month to help spread awareness around prevention and treatment of heart disease. Choosing a healthy diet is important for a healthy heart, and for Chino Valley Ranchers, that means incorporating eggs into your diet.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Eggs offer several beneficial nutrients to promote overall health. Aside from being excellent sources of selenium, vitamin B, phosphorus and riboflavin, eggs are one of the most affordable proteins available. Each large egg also contains around 70 calories, which aids in feelings of satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://healthyforgood.heart.org/eat-smart\">American Heart Association</a> recommends having a diet that contains a variety of nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, nuts, and legumes. For decades, consumers have been given mixed messages about dietary cholesterol, especially as it relates to eggs. However, research continues to prove that healthy adults can enjoy eggs daily without affecting their risk of heart disease. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077734\">recent studies</a> have shown that eggs may have heart protective qualities. According to one <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27710205\">study</a> in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, daily egg intake led to a 12 percent reduced risk of stroke. Other <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28091798\">research</a> found that healthy individuals who eat one to three eggs per day have increased HDL (“good” cholesterol) levels and an improved blood lipid profile.</p>\n<p>Here at Chino Valley Ranchers, we understand that eggs provide an affordable indulgence and are a convenient way to add protein to any kind of dish. That’s why our goal has been to provide our customers with nutrient-dense egg products that they can readily incorporate into a healthy and well-balanced diet.</p>\n<p>Join Chino Valley Ranchers this month in celebrating American Heart Month!
