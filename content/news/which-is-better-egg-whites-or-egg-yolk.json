Is it better to eat eggs that are cage-free or pasture-raised? Organic or conventional? This week, we’re answering another popular question: are egg whites or egg yolks better for your health?<!--more--></p>\n<p>It may help to start by understanding the role of the egg yolk versus the egg white in a fertilized egg. The egg white acts as a protective layer to defend a growing chick from bacterial infection. It’s mostly water, with about 4 grams of protein. On the other hand, the egg yolk contains most of the micronutrients and fat, making it a vital component of the whole egg.</p>\n<p>Most people tend to think that since the egg yolk contains cholesterol and fat, it’s unhealthy to consume and will raise cholesterol levels. Contrary to popular belief, the egg yolk is a very nutrient dense component and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205602\">does not have a significant impact on the actual cholesterol concentration in your blood</a>. In fact, consuming one, two or even three eggs per day <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health\">has been proven</a> to be consistent with a healthy diet.</p>\n<p>In summary, while the egg yolks have the most nutrients, the egg whites contain most of the protein. But together, the egg white and egg yolk contribute to the highest nutritional value. Having a balanced diet is important for everyone, so make sure that you’re getting all the nutrients you need by eating a variety of foods and restricting less.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we understand that eggs make up many healthy diets, which is why we provide our hens with thriving environments to ensure that you receive nutrient-dense, organic eggs that taste delicious.
