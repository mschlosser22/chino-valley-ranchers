Put all ingredients in a food processor and pulse several times. Do not over pulse. Crust should still look crumbly but stick together like dough when pressed together. Press evenly onto the bottoms of a greased mini muffin or 12-cup mini cheesecake pan. Bake crust for 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Filling:</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1- 8oz package of cream cheese</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 Tbsp sour cream</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/4 cup sugar</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 Tbsp lemon juice, fresh</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Zest of one lemon</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/2 tsp vanilla extract</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 Chino Valley Ranchers organic eggs</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lemon Curd (store purchased or prepared)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Beat the cream cheese, sour cream and sugar together with a mixer on medium until thoroughly blended. Add in lemon juice and mix well. Add in lemon zest, vanilla and the eggs. Beat until creamy consistency. Evenly add the cream cheese mixture to the crusts. Bake at 325 degrees for 17-20 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Once cooled, spread a thin layer of lemon curd on top of the cheesecakes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Meringue:</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/4 cup Chino Valley Ranchers organic egg whites</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/4 tsp cream of tater</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6 Tbsp sugar</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1/2 tsp vanilla extract</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Set oven to broil. Beat egg whites on medium until frothy. Add in cream of tartar and beat until fluffy. Add one Tbsp of sugar at a time while continuing to beat the egg whites. Beat until the eggs form thick peaks. Add the vanilla and beat for 30 more seconds. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Top the lemon curd layer with the meringue topping. Use a decorative tip to pipe the meringue if you have one. Immediately place the cheesecakes back in the oven and broil for about one minute (or less depending on how hot your oven is). Check every 30 seconds to prevent burning. Broil just until meringue tops are golden brown.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The recipe creates 12 mini cheesecakes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This delicious recipe is by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spinmeaneatclean/\">Michelle Pittman</a>. Find more recipes like this on her Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spinmeaneatclean/\">@spinmeaneatclean</a>! </strong></p>\n"}
