Prepare the dough.</strong></p>\n<p>Arrange a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat to 500°F.</p>\n<p>Lightly oil and dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Shape your pizza dough into a flattened circle, making sure to push gently. Try to avoid over-kneading, since that can create a harder crust. Once you’ve shaped your dough, place it onto the baking sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Decorate your pizza.</strong></p>\n<p>Spread enough pizza sauce to cover the top of your dough, making sure to leave some room on the edges for extra crunch. Sprinkle on some shredded mozzarella – the cheesier the better! In a separate bowl, toss your cherry tomatoes with a small amount of olive oil, then arrange them on your pizza. Top it off with some freshly ground pepper and place your pizza in the oven to bake.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Top off with eggs.</strong></p>\n<p>Bake your pizza until the crust is lightly browned, but not crisped – this usually takes about 7 minutes. Keeping the oven on, remove the pizza and crack a couple of eggs on top. Return the pizza into the oven and continue baking for another 6 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the crust is golden brown. Remove your pizza from the oven and sprinkle with some red pepper flakes for added punch. Slice and enjoy immediately!</p>\n<p>There you have it – a Chino Valley Ranchers’ breakfast recipe to satisfy your pizza and egg cravings!
