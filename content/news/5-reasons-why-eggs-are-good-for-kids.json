Eggs can help with bone growth. </strong></p>\n<p>In order to grow strong and healthy bones, kids need a lot of vitamin D, which eggs just so happen to have plenty of. While you can get vitamin D by exposing your skin to sunlight or by taking a supplement, kids can also get a healthy amount of vitamin D by eating eggs. In fact, eggs are one of the few foods that contain vitamin D. So avoid your kids getting sunburned and have them eat eggs instead!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Eggs have the right balance of fats.</strong></p>\n<p>As your child grows, it’s important for them to consume a healthy balance of saturated and unsaturated fats. Fortunately, eggs have a perfect balance of the two, making it a yummy and healthy snack for your child.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Eggs can contribute to healthy eyes. </strong></p>\n<p>Eggs contain zeaxanthin and lutein, two carotenoids that are key for having healthy eyes. Specifically, these items help keep your vision sharp and your retina healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Eggs can improve the strength of hair and nails. </strong></p>\n<p>There are nine amino acids in eggs that also help in the healthy strength and growth of your child’s hair and nails.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Eggs help a child’s brain development.</strong></p>\n<p>Eggs have both omega-3s and the B12 vitamin within them, which are crucial for the development of your child’s brain.</p>\n<p>Chino Valley Ranchers wants your children to be as healthy as can be, which is why our eggs are always the freshest and most delicious eggs around.
