Eggs can be scrambled, poached, sunny side up, boiled or baked. Most of us think we know all there is to know about eggs and preparing them. But if you’re ready to learn about 7 exciting ways to enjoy eggs, we’ve got the list!</span><!--more--></p>\n<p><b>Soft-cooked</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boil 2 cups of water and remove the pot from the stove. Add ¾ cup of water at room temperature and drop the egg into the pot. Cover for about 17 minutes. You can enjoy the egg cracked over pasta, avocado toast, soup, or porridge. </span></p>\n<p><b>Torched!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by soft-boiling a few eggs, then peel and slice in half. Sprinkle some salt and sugar, and torch them. The salt and sugar will caramelize and surprise you with a sweet and crunchy bite. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bagged</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perfect your omelette by using a resealable plastic bag. Fill the bag with whisked eggs, salt, and your desired fillings. Place the bag in a pot of simmering water and cook until the eggs set. Slide the omelette out of the bag and enjoy!</span></p>\n<p><b>Cured</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by combining equal parts salt and sugar (the cure) in a shallow container. Create shallow wells in the cure mixture and place an egg yolk in each well. Cover the yolks with the cure, close the container, and refrigerate for 7 days. After 7 days, dust off the egg yolks and bake at 200 ℉ for about 30 minutes. You can grate the egg yolks over vegetables, pasta, or soup to add a salty and crunchy bite. </span></p>\n<p><b>Rolled</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bring home a taste of Japan by making a Japanese rolled omelette called tamagoyaki. Combine raw eggs, dashi (a broth), sugar and soy sauce in a pan. Roll the mixture over itself every few minutes to form a tight spiral shape. </span></p>\n<p><b>Falafel-ized</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No need to choose between eggs and falafel if you can have both. Start by soft boiling the eggs, then coat with a falafel mixture, and fry them. </span></p>\n<p><b>Marinated</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can marinate boiled eggs in soy sauce with some sugar and sherry vinegar for a salty surprise. Or you can use a mixture of garlic, chiles, mirin, and vinegar for a spicier and bolder flavor. </span></p>\n<p><b>Sources</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/articles/weird-ways-to-cook-eggs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/articles/weird-ways-to-cook-eggs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tasty.co/article/jesseszewczyk/ways-to-cook-an-egg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://tasty.co/article/jesseszewczyk/ways-to-cook-an-egg</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n"}
