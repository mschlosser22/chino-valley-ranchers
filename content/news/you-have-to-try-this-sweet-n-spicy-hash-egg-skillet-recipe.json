Do you know the difference between conventional eggs vs cage free organic eggs? Conventional eggs come from hens that are typically fed grains, corn, soy &amp; an unnatural diet of supplemented vitamins + minerals. Cage-free organic eggs are laid by cage-free hens that are raised on certified organic feed with access to outdoors. Because of this, cage-free organic eggs are naturally higher in vitamins A, E, &amp; omega-3s.<!--more--></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever cracked &amp; compared the yolks of a conventional egg vs a cage-free organic egg, you can literally see the difference. The conventional egg yolk is pale in color typically because the hens had no access to the outdoors &amp; are fed mainly grains. While the cage-free organic egg yolk is bright orange in color which typically indicates the hens were fed a well-balanced, nutritional diet with access to sunlight.</p>\n<p>Being someone who truly cares where my food comes from, I love working with local companies like <a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chino Valley Ranchers. </a>They simply let chickens do what they are supposed to do. Chino Valley hens are fed the highest-quality organic feed from certified pesticide-free fields, &amp; have access to soil &amp; vegetation where they can dust bathe, scratch, &amp; fresh air. They always have unlimited access to fresh food + water &amp; sometimes they choose to forage for food outdoors.</p>\n<p>Matt eats eggs more than any other food in his diet. So it’s incredibly important to me to purchase our eggs from companies like Chino Valley! Over the weekend, I made a spicy sweet potato hash with organic soy-free eggs nestled in the skillet. It was so simple &amp; we’ll definitely be making this a regular thing!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2739\" src=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1000w-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"328\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1000w-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1000w-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1000w-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n<p>1/2 sweet onion, diced</p>\n<p>2-3 medium sweet potatoes, chopped</p>\n<p>1/4 lb organic ground chorizo, cooked</p>\n<p>2 Chino Valley Ranchers organic soy-free eggs</p>\n<p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>\n<p>2 tbsp avocado oil</p>\n<p>1 tsp chili powder</p>\n<p>1/4 tsp smoked paprika</p>\n<p>1/8 tsp cayenne pepper</p>\n<p>1/8 tsp cinnamon</p>\n<p>1/4 tsp pink salt</p>\n<p>Freshly ground pepper</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 400.</p>\n<p>Heat 2 tbsp avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
