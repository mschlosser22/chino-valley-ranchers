But a poor frying pan can turn every meal into a disaster. To find a frying pan that will serve you well, here are a few factors to consider.</p><p></p><p><strong>Material</strong></p><p>Frying pans can be made with stainless steel, cast iron, aluminum, carbon steel, and copper. Frying pans can also be made with clay and stone, and have non-stick surfaces. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, so it’s important to consider what’s important to you before making a purchase.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>For example, stainless steel pans are easy to clean but don’t conduct heat very well. To address this, most cookware companies add copper or aluminum to stainless steel products.</p><p></p><p><strong>Health factor</strong></p><p>When shopping for a frying pan, make sure it’s PFOA-free, BPA free, and PTFE free. Avoid frying pans that have coatings made of unusual chemicals.<br></p><p>A few safe options include stainless steel, regular non-stick, hard-anodized aluminum, and seasoned cast iron.<br></p><p><strong>Size</strong></p><p>Frying pans come in a variety of sizes. Smaller pans are great for frying eggs, while larger ones are designed for making skillet recipes and stir fry meals.</p><p></p><p>Make sure the bottom of the frying pan isn’t bigger than the space of one stove burner to support heat transfer and minimize energy waste.</p><p></p><p><strong>Handle and grip</strong></p><p>A frying pan is no good if the handle is poorly attached or doesn’t have a solid grip. Avoid frying pans that have handles attached with a few small screws and choose one that is sturdy and stays cool to the touch during cooking. Depending on your budget, find a frying pan that heats evenly, is easy to lift, and built to last.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cleaning</strong></p><p>Not all frying pans are dishwasher safe and oven-safe. Decide how you want to use the frying pan (strictly for stovetop cooking or baking as well) before making a purchase. Generally, oven-safe frying pans are dishwasher-safe. To lengthen the life of your frying pan, it’s best to wash by hand and avoid the dishwasher.<br></p><p><strong>Top Rated Frying Pans</strong></p><p>If you’re looking for the best frying pans on the market, a few options to consider are:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>GreenPan Reserve Nonstick Frying Pan</p></li><li><p>Butter Pat Joan Cast Iron Skillet</p></li><li><p>Tramontina 80131/066DS Cast-Iron Frying Pan</p></li><li><p>Le Creuset Poele Stainless Steel Frying Pan</p></li><li><p>De Buyer Mineral B French Collection 5670P Carbon Steel Frying Pan</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Brooklyn Copper Sauté Frying Pan</p></li></ul>"}
