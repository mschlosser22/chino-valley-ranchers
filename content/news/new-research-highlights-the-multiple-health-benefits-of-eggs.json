Gone are the days when eggs were thought to contain excess cholesterol and were to be avoided. Studies have since shown dietary cholesterol doesn’t elevate blood cholesterol as previously reported. Dr. Tanya Zuckerbrot was quoted in an interview with Fox News.com, “…while one whole egg contains about 240 mg of cholesterol and 8 percent of your daily allowance for saturated fat…the American Heart Association says you can eat up to four egg yolks per week. In my practice I tell patients they can use egg whites as their source of protein for all meals if they want.” Some of the lesser known, yet important health benefits of eggs include enhanced memory, sharper vision and stronger bones. Eggs also contain a series of amino acids needed to build keratins, which have been found to help keep skin and hair healthy.</p>\n<p><!--more--><br />\nChino Valley Ranchers President Steve Nichols talked about the study, “It has taken years to get the word out about the health benefits of eggs and to dispel myths about their impact on cholesterol levels.” Nichols continued, “Over the years, studies have consistently found cholesterol levels can be largely affected by hereditary factors, rather than purely based on dietary intake of cholesterol.”<br />\nChino Valley Ranchers, a Southern California based producer of organic eggs located in Arcadia, offers a wide variety of eggs, which are all certified organic.
