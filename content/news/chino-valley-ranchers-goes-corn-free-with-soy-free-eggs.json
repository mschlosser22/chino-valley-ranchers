  "content": "<p>Chino Valley Ranchers, a leading producer of organic, cage-free and pasture raised eggs, announced today that their soy-free eggs are now also corn-free. The move comes in response to consumer demand for eggs that are free from common allergens and dietary restrictions.</p><p>Chino Valley Ranchers' Soy-Free Organic Omega-3 eggs are already popular among consumers seeking a healthy and delicious egg option. The eggs come from hens raised in free-roaming environments and fed a special soy-free diet that contains flaxseed, a grain naturally high in Omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the removal of corn from their diet, Chino Valley Ranchers' Soy-Free Organic Omega-3 eggs are even more allergen-friendly and suitable for a wider range of diets. Each egg still contains 225 mg of Omega-3, also known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which has been shown to have positive health effects in humans, especially for cardiovascular health.</p><p></p><p>\"We're thrilled to offer our customers an even more allergen-friendly egg option with the removal of corn from our hens' diet,\" said Chris Nichols, CEO of Chino Valley Ranchers. \"We understand the importance of providing high-quality eggs that meet the needs and preferences of all consumers, and we're committed to continuing to innovate and improve our product offerings.\"</p><p></p><p>Chino Valley Ranchers' Soy-Free Organic Omega-3 eggs are available now in stores nationwide.</p>"
