The less dishes I have to do in my tiny sink, the better haha. Shakshouka </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is on the menu today! To make: sauté a little garlic in avocado oil and add half a can of tomato sauce to the pan. Once the sauce is hot add a hand full </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of spinach, thinly sliced tomato&#8217;s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two @chinovalleyranchers pasture raised eggs, green onions, salt, pepper and chili flakes. Allow the egg whites to cook all the way through. Top with cilantro and enjoy. I like to eat my shakshouka</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with sourdough bread.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking about the Instagram post, Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers Chris Nichols says, “A shakshuka is a simple, delicious and easy-to-make breakfast dish I am happy to indulge in, especially if the recipe calls for Chino Valley Ranchers pasture raised eggs.
