Today, more than 50 years later, The Nichols family is continuing to provide an environment for chickens to roam free and live healthy lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Humane, Happy and Healthy</strong></p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we are all about humane practices because we know that happier hens lay healthier eggs. This means we utilize cage free environments for our pasture-raised chickens, and of course, all-organic upbringings from the Pullet Farm where we raise our chickens to the Egg Ranch where our mature hens lay their eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Cage Free Environments</strong></p>\n<p>There are different kinds of cage free facilities. The first allows hens to roam around freely in an open building, barn or poultry house with unlimited access to fresh food and water. Then, there are pasture-raised hens, who have even more access to the outdoors to forage for food naturally and live the most normal life possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Certified Organic</strong></p>\n<p>By “organic,” that refers specifically to the type of food being provided to the chickens that lay the eggs. At Chino Valley Ranchers, we have specially formulated feeds that we make ourselves from only all-natural and 100 percent certified organic ingredients known to be beneficial to the chickens and the eggs they ultimately produce. There are many strict government regulations for the eggs to be considered organic. These include diets that must be free of any antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides and growth hormones. Organic hens must also be given access to the outdoors and raised in cage free environments.</p>\n<p><strong>The Legacy of Chino Valley Ranchers</strong></p>\n<p>Cage free and organic practices have been a part of Chino Valley Ranchers for over four decades. It’s not because we knew that someday organic regulations would be put in place. It’s because we know it’s the right thing to do. Our chickens are given a natural, healthy life that allows them to thrive and lay some of the most delicious and nutritious organic eggs you’ll find anywhere.</p>\n<p>To learn more about organic and cage free egg farming practices at Chino Valley Ranchers, <a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">contact us today</a>.</p>\n"}
