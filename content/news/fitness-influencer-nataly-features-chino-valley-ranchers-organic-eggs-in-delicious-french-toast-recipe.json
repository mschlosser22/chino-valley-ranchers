By doing so, our hens are able to enjoy healthier lives, which in turn produces better quality eggs.”</p>\n<p>In her recipe, Perez uses Chino Valley Ranchers’ Organic Pasture Raised Eggs to give her French toast extra nutrition and flavor. Her recipe calls for two Chino Valley Ranchers’ Organic Pasture Raised Eggs, adding 12 grams of protein, 500 milligrams of choline and 9 essential amino acids to the overall mix. The final product is two pieces of French toast, made with a delicious combination of bee pollen, nectarines, cinnamon and ricotta cheese. “Totally wishing I could enjoy this French toast all over again,” said Perez. “Boy, were they delicious!”</p>\n<p>Perez has committed her life to health and fitness, presenting a new healthy recipe and words of encouragement to her fan base of more than 42,000 followers.
