In conventional farming, the requirements are pretty simple: hire a team to spray the farm with herbicides and insecticides and add nutrients and fertilizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a farmer decides to start producing organic produce or feed, they must learn how to manage soil nutrients without fertilizer and fight weeds and insects without herbicides and insecticides. Other challenges include purchasing new equipment to handle organic farming and making other up-front investments. Organic farming requires more labor to tackle weeds and manage soil quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic farmers are also required to rotate crops to maintain USDA organic certification. Because the majority of grain storage facilities and transportation networks are geared towards conventional crops, organic farmers need to find a market structure adhering to the requirements of organic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Organic Poultry</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic egg producers are also required to make large investments into equipment and operations. To maintain organic certification, farmers must give their hens feed free of supplements and additives, refrain from using hormones and build housing that reduces the possibility of diseases, parasites and predation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making the switch to organic requires going against the grain and intentionally prioritizing the well-being of hens above extra profit. For decades, Chino Valley Ranchers has been committed to producing organic eggs and looking after the health and wellness of its hens.
