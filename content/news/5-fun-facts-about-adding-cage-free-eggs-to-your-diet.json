They contain about 40 different kinds of proteins that aid in metabolism, making them easy to digest.</li>\n<li>They reduce the risk of breast cancer. A recent study revealed that women who consumed high amounts of choline were 24% less likely to get breast cancer. Guess what? Choline is abundant in cage-free eggs. Choline is also important for pregnant and breastfeeding women, as it aids in brain and memory development for both mom and baby.</li>\n<li>They are a low-calorie food. Depending on the size and preparation method, cage-free eggs can range from 45 up to 100 calories. Because they are full of nutrients and good fats like oleic and linoleic acid, they leave you feeling fuller for longer, too. Winner, winner, eggs for dinner.</li>\n<li>They help make hair and nails strong and healthy. Humane harvest eggs contain sulfur, which helps promote nail and hair growth.</li>\n<li>They help keep your eyes healthy.
