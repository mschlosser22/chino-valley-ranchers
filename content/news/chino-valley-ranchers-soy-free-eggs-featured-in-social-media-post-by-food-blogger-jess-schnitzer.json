Matt literally eats eggs more than anything else in his diet. So making sure we’re buying from a company like Chino Valley Ranchers who practice organic farming techniques &amp; prides themselves on how they treat + what they feed their hens is incredibly important to me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers, Chris Nichols, says, “We couldn’t be more grateful to each individual who shares in our values for organic and humane farming. The support we receive from our customers helps us continue doing what we love and enable others to live a healthy lifestyle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jess Schnitzen lives in San Juan Capistrano, CA, and started her blog “shut the fig up” to share dairy-free and gluten-free recipes.
