These days, consumers can buy organic <em>anything</em> it seems—from fruits and veggies to meat, dairy and even crackers. When it comes to organic eggs, they tend to be our specialty. At Chino Valley Ranchers, we know what goes into making hens happier and healthier, and happy hens definitely produce better eggs.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Here are a few additional reasons why organic eggs are so important:</p>\n<p><strong>1. They Are Certified Free of Hormones, Pesticides, and GMOs</strong></p>\n<p>Organic egg farmers like Chino Valley Ranchers must be certified as organic farmers. There are certain standards we must abide by in terms of growing, feeding, storage and packaging of our eggs to make sure they are free of unnatural hormones, pesticides, and GMOs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Better Diets for the Hens</strong></p>\n<p>A key aspect of producing organic eggs is making sure that the hens are given quality feed and that the feed itself is 100 percent certified organic. We offer a range of specific diets for our hens, from soy-free to flaxseed-enriched, to produce eggs with natural nutritional benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Happy Cage-Free Birds</strong></p>\n<p>The hens at Chino Valley Ranchers are allowed to roam free and live a normal chicken lifestyle. They are able to take dust baths, socialize and do the things that they enjoy. We’ve found that happier hens produce better eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Strict Organic Regulations</strong></p>\n<p>All organic farmers are regularly audited by food and health commissions to make sure they are not mistreating their birds. If any mistreatment of chickens is found or diets are proven to have non-organic elements, the organic certification can be revoked. As an organic farm, we are held accountable for the treatment of our hens in order to make sure that our eggs remain the highest quality and stay 100 percent organic.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we are committed to bringing our customers the healthiest organic eggs possible. We take the USDA regulations seriously, but more importantly, we take your health seriously! So the next time you think, “<em>why organic eggs?”</em>, remember us and our commitment to you.</p>\n<p>To learn more about our organic eggs and farming process, <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">contact</a> Chino Valley Ranchers today.</p>\n"}
