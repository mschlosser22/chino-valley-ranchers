Boil your eggs. </strong></p>\n<p>Start off by putting your Chino Valley Ranchers eggs in a pot of boiling water for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the eggs are just the way you like them. Drain the water from the pot and then let the eggs cool. Once they are cool enough, peel the shell off of the eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Create the juice.</strong></p>\n<p>Mix the beet juice, vinegar, sugar, pickling spices and crushed garlic all together in a saucepan until it comes to a boil. Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about four to six minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Put the jar together.</strong></p>\n<p>Place half of the beets in the jar to fill up to one third of the entire jar. Then add the peeled hard-boiled eggs. Top off the last third of the jar with the second half of beets. Finally, pour the simmered juice in the jar and seal it up.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Let it cool.</strong></p>\n<p>Shake the sealed jar so that all of the ingredients are mixed together. Then place the jar in the refrigerator for at least one full week.</p>\n<p>And with that, you have a delicious dish to serve at your next dinner party!
