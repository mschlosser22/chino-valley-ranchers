Whether they are scrambled, fried, poached or hard-boiled, eggs are versatile and inexpensive sources of quality nutrients. But, eggs are also so much more. Here at Chino Valley Ranchers, we’ve come up with three more reasons why you should incorporate eggs into your diet.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Eggs contain choline – an important vitamin.<br />\n</strong>Choline is a nutrient that most people don’t get enough of, let alone know that it exists. It’s abundantly found in eggs and helps with brain function and the building of cell membranes. Whole eggs are considered a great dietary source of choline, containing more than 100 mg per serving.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Eggs can improve the health of your eyes.<br />\n</strong>Eggs contain antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which have been proven to counteract degenerative processes that affect our eyes. Studies show that these powerful antioxidants can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723441\">significantly reduce</a> the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, which are two very common eye disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Eggs promote “good” cholesterol.<br />\n</strong>Because eggs contain cholesterol, people oftentimes assume they should stay away. But some may not realize that our bodies make cholesterol every day and it’s the <em>type</em> of cholesterol that will make it good or bad for us. High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), otherwise known as the “good” cholesterol, tends to rise when one consumes eggs. Those that have a higher HDL level typically are at a lower risk for developing heart and health problems.</p>\n<p>It’s not very often you find a food that tastes great and is also good for you – but eggs do just that!
