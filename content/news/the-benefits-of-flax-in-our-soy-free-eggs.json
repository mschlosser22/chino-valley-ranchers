It features a special blend of organic grains and seeds that replaces the nutritional content found in soy. One of the ingredients we add is organic flaxseed, which boosts the omega-3 fatty acid content in the eggs, making it an excellent supplement.</p>\n<p>Take a look at some of the other reasons why flax is beneficial to Chino Valley Ranchers’ soy-free, omega-3 eggs:</p>\n<p><strong>Healthy Fat</strong></p>\n<p>Flaxseed includes many healthy fats, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the primary one. When ingested, ALA splits into two different omega-3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA. ALA is the most effective of the omega-3 fatty acids and contributes to overall health in infants and adults. Just one Chino Valley Ranchers soy-free omega-3 eggs can help balance the levels of three important omega-3 fatty acids in your body.</p>\n<p><strong>Healthy Heart</strong></p>\n<p>Research proves that omega-3 fatty acids are important to our health, especially when it comes to our hearts. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from Chino Valley Ranchers’ soy-free eggs can lower the presence of fat in the blood and reduce blood pressure. It also reduces platelet activity in the bloodstream, which helps minimize plaque build up in arteries that could lead to coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Healthy People</strong></p>\n<p>Omega-3 and its counterpart, omega-6, are considered essential fatty acids because the body cannot synthesize them. It is recommended to consume a 1:1 ratio of these two fatty acids; however, most Americans overconsume omega-6 fatty acids, which counteracts the effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Having the right balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is important for reducing these opposing effects and creating equilibrium.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, providing healthy products is our number one priority, whether it’s for the hens who produce our eggs or for our customers who buy and eat them. We always feed our hens organic diets that are free of antibiotics, steroids, and hormones, which means better eggs for you.
