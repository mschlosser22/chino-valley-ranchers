To get this Friday started I had to start off with a protein-rich frittata made with @chinovalleyranchers eggs! What I love about frittatas is the amount of versatility they have; from using up leftovers or just rummaging through the fridge and adding in random veggies, the options are limitless! Enjoy!” The recipe calls for four Chino Valley Ranchers eggs, almond milk, onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, cilantro and parmesan cheese. </span><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking about the Instagram post, Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers Chris Nichols says, “I’m always up for a frittata made with organic Chino Valley Ranchers eggs for breakfast and this one looks especially delicious.
