Some love sunny side up, others like scrambled, while others want over-easy. The question that we’d like to tackle is, “What do you use to actually fry the eggs?” Butter? Oil? The additional alternatives are ghee, margarine, and bacon grease. The three types of oils that you could use to fry eggs include olive oil, avocado oil, and corn oil. Here’s what you should know about the benefits of each.<br></p><p><strong>Butter</strong></p><p>Butter — especially grass-fed and organic butter — has a creamy and smooth texture that makes it great for frying eggs. But it’s not the lowest calorie option, as a single tablespoon of salted butter has about 100 calories and 11.5 grams of fat.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ghee</strong></p><p>Ghee has a more concentrated flavor than regular butter and is made by skimming milk solids out of melted butter. Ghee is high in butyric acid, which can help reduce inflammation and support gut health.</p><p></p><p><strong>Olive Oil</strong></p><p>There are many olive oil options to choose from. Some brands incorporate flavors like butter, herbs, pepper, fruit, or even spice. Olive oil is high in fatty acids, particularly monounsaturated oleic acid, which can help reduce the risk of heart disease. The phenolic compounds in olive oil also have anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p></p><p><strong>Margarine</strong></p><p>This butter alternative is made from vegetable oils and can vary widely in flavor. Margarine may take some getting used to, in terms of flavor as some say it tastes artificial and overpowering.<br></p><p><strong>Corn Oil</strong></p><p>Corn oil will make the edges of fried eggs crispy and it’s an inexpensive option to cook with. However, corn oil is high in linoleic acid, which is an omega-6 fat that can increase the risk of heart disease, obesity, depression, and impaired brain function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Avocado Oil</strong></p><p>Definitely not the cheapest oil at your local grocery store, but it has become a popular option among those who love its smooth consistency, nutty flavor, and high smoke point.</p><p></p><p><strong>Bacon Grease</strong></p><p>If nutrition isn’t a concern, then bacon grease will give you the smoky rich flavor you’re craving with your fried eggs. A few tablespoons of bacon grease will be enough to prepare fried eggs that are truly out of this world.</p>"}
