To be certified organic, crops used in chicken feed cannot contain any pesticides or herbicides. In addition, the crops cannot be genetically modified or be fertilized with chemical or synthetic products. The chickens must be raised without the use of antibiotics, hormones, or other pharmaceuticals. </span></p>\n<p><b>The Benefits of Buying Organic Eggs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hens that are raised organic are also free to roam outside, consuming plants, grasses and insects that can help improve the nutritional quality of Omega-3 fatty acids in eggs.

But what kind of effect does eating non-organic have on health? Various pesticides can affect the nervous system, be toxic to humans, be poisonous to certain animals, and contain heavy metals like copper. Studies have shown that accidental exposures to high levels of pesticides can lead to cancer, autism, and ADHD. Though the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set limits to the levels of pesticides that can be used, eating organic can significantly reduce the amount of residual pesticides consumed.  </span></p>\n"}
