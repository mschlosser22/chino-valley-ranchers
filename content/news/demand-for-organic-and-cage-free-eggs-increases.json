To be more precise, the organic, cage free, humane harvest egg. With raised awareness about the horrors of factory farms, consumers have become more concerned about how and where their food products are sourced. Are vegetables and grain grown free of pesticides and genetic modifications? And are they fed to our livestock and poultry, which in turn feed us? Are they raised under humane conditions? These are all <em>egg-cellent</em> questions!<!--more--></p>\n<p>When it comes to eggs, the demand for healthy, happy hens is high. Marketers have responded to the demand from consumers and though battery cages are not yet illegal in the United States, alternative approaches are being explored.</p>\n<p>SEE ALSO: <a href=\"http://chinovalleyranchers.com/blog/large-corporations-make-cage-free-egg-promises/\">Large Corporations Make Cage-Free Egg Promises</a></p>\n<p>According to David Sprinkle, research director at Packaged Facts, â€œNot too many years ago organic and cage free eggs were available almost exclusively from either farm stands, farmers markets or in specialty natural or health food stores. Today they are easily found in mainstream supermarkets.</p>\n<p>Packaged Facts estimates that about 90% of households in the United States use eggs. We are <em>egg-static</em> about that statistic! At Chino Valley Ranchers, we take good care of our laying hens. We offer several different humane harvest options for our customers, including <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/our_eggs_soy_free_organic.php\">soy free eggs</a>, cage free eggs, and <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/our_eggs_organic.php\">organic eggs</a>. Our hens are happy, as they are allowed to run free, take dust baths, eat bugs and grasses, socialize with each other, and just do the things that chickens like to do. We take the health of our hens (and subsequently, their eggs) very seriously, so when you buy from Chino Valley Ranchers, you can rest assured that you are buying only the healthiest, happiest of eggs. <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/contact_us.php\">Contact us</a> today if you have any questions!</p>\n"}
