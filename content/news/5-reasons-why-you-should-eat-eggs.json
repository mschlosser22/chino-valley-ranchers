They are inexpensive, an excellent source of protein and can help improve your overall health. But these aren’t the only positive aspects to eating eggs – here are five more reasons why you will want to add eggs to your daily diet.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Eggs leave you feeling full.</strong></p>\n<p>Life can get hectic, and sometimes there isn’t enough time to eat, let alone eat something healthy. Because of this, you want to make sure that you are eating something that will sustain your energy for a good amount of time. Plus, it helps if they’re quick and simple to make. Eggs provide both of these.</p>\n<p><strong>2. They can assist with your weight loss goals. </strong></p>\n<p>Eggs help sustain energy levels, which will not only keep you satisfied for longer, but will also keep you steadily focused to get through the whole day. Since eggs are also so filling, you will be less likely to reach for a mid-morning snack after having Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs for breakfast!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Don’t forget muscle gain!</strong></p>\n<p>While eggs help with weight loss, particularly that of fat, they can also help you gain muscle. This is due to the amount of protein found in eggs, which is very useful in building muscle. Since a whole egg contains all of the amino acids necessary for a healthy diet, it is one of the best sources of protein available.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Eggs help with brain processes, such as memory.</strong></p>\n<p>Choline is a macronutrient that helps support energy level, maintain metabolism and support brain development. It has been found to help increase memory retention and alertness. And it just so happens that eggs have a near-ideal amount of choline!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Eggs protect your eyesight. </strong></p>\n<p>Eggs also have two excellent antioxidants, leutin and zeaxanthin, that have been linked to protecting eyes from the damage of UV rays. These antioxidants have also been associated with decreasing the likelihood of cataract development.</p>\n<p>We at Chino Valley Ranchers want you and your family to be healthy and happy, and our eggs can help with that.
