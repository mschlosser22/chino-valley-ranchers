Get the oven ready. </strong></p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 375° Fahrenheit. Then, take a 12-cup muffin pan and spray the cups with cooking spray or place baking cups in the pan. That way, when they are done, the muffins don’t stick to the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Mix your vegetables.</strong></p>\n<p>Take a bowl and start adding the vegetables of your choice into it. Mix the ingredients together so they are evenly spread out. Then place them in the pan cups until each one is about three-fourths full.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Prepare your eggs.</strong></p>\n<p>Crack your Chino Valley Rancher eggs into a bowl and whisk the eggs. For flavor, add salt and pepper as you whisk. Once they are to your liking, pour two to four tablespoons of egg into each pan cup, depending on how much egg you like.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Add cheese.</strong></p>\n<p>Top the cups off with a sprinkle of cheese for each muffin.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Ready, set bake!</strong></p>\n<p>Bake the muffins in the oven for about twenty minutes. To check if they are ready to come out, poke a toothpick through one to see if it is cooked all the way through. Let them cool for five to ten minutes.</p>\n<p>You can choose to eat the muffins that day or prepare them ahead of time for an on-the-go breakfast during the workweek. Whatever you do, just be sure to use Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs for the dish. Our eggs always taste great and are of a higher quality than most eggs you see.
