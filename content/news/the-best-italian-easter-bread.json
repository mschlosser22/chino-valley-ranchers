This is a great recipe to make while you make other items. First, you’ll add the yeast and milk to the mixing bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes.</p><p></p><p>Next, you’ll add the butter, eggs and sugar to combine. I used Chino Valley Ranchers Organic Omega-3 Soy Free eggs. These eggs are made with a special soy and corn-free diet, that contains flax seed—a grain naturally high in Omega-3 fatty acids reaching levels of around 225mg or more. Their organic eggs have the most brilliant colored yolks, amazing taste and are high quality.<br><br>Add the flour slowly to combine into the dough. Knead the dough on low until its tacky and not sticky. Then add the dough to an olive oil coated bowl to let rise for an hour.</p><p><br>Dye your uncooked eggs while you wait for the dough to rise. Then, cut the dough into 12 pieces and roll into 12 inch ropes. Braid the dough by twisting two ropes together and then pinch them at the ends to join.</p><p></p><p>Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with a towel for one hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and add an egg wash to the bread dough.</p><p></p><p>Sprinkle with rainbow non-pareils sprinkles. Add dyed non-cooked eggs to the center of each bread. Bake for 20-25 minutes.</p>"
