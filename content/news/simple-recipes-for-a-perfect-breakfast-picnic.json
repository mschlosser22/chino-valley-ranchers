Deviled eggs, buttermilk donuts, and an Italian sandwich are easy to make and will make your picnic a delight.</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Italian Sandwich Torte</strong></p><p>Don’t be intimidated by the word “torte.” The name of this dish is more complex than the actual process of preparing it. The ingredients include two crescent rolls, ½ pound sliced deli salami, ½ pound sliced provolone, ½ pound sliced deli ham, seven large Chino Valley Ranchers eggs, one cup grated Parmesan cheese, one to two cups of fresh spinach, and one 24-ounce jar of roasted red peppers.</p><p></p><p>View the full <a href=\"https://www.shugarysweets.com/italian-sandwich-torte/\">recipe</a>.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Deviled Eggs</strong></p><p>Properly boiling the eggs is half of the battle. You’ll need to boil water before placing the eggs in the pot. Allow the eggs to boil for 30 seconds, and then simmer on low heat for 14 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pot and place them in an ice bath for at least 15 minutes. To make the filling, you’ll need ⅓ cup mayonnaise, one tablespoon of yellow mustard, one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p><p></p><p>View the full <a href=\"https://www.thelazydish.com/the-best-classic-deviled-eggs/\">recipe</a>.<br></p><p><strong>3.
