Walk past the egg section and you’ll see cartons labeled “cage-free”, “free-range”, and “pasture-raised”. With so many labels, it can be hard to know exactly what each term means. Some terms are regulated, while others are used for marketing purposes.</p><p></p><p><strong>How Are Pasture-Raised Eggs Special?</strong></p><p>When it comes to eggs, it’s important to understand what’s so special about pasture-raised and certified humane eggs.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Free-range and cage-free eggs have a bright yellow yolk, while pasture-raised eggs have golden orange yolks. This is because pasture-raised hens have at least 108 square feet of outdoor space to roam and graze on days with good weather conditions. Golden yolks not only taste better, but also contain a higher level of vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids than conventional eggs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The yolk color will also vary depending on the season. For example, hens eat less in the summer due to high temperatures, but more in the winter to stay warm. Eggs laid during the summer tend to be brighter than eggs laid during the winter.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why Choose Pasture-Raised Eggs</strong></p><p>Chino Valley Ranchers takes great care to ensure each hen has access to direct sunlight, fresh air, and healthy feed. Our pasture-raised eggs come from hens free to roam our pastures and to feed on bugs and worms they find outdoors.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Each hen is also provided with organic feed designed by an animal nutritionist to ensure hens are healthy and well-fed. The quality of each hen’s daily life will have a direct impact on the quality of eggs produced.</p><p></p><p>Though pasture-raised eggs are more expensive than conventional eggs, they are worth it nutritionally. Eggs are one of the only foods that naturally contain vitamin D, which supports the immune system, regulates hormones, and helps maintain bone strength.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Pasture-raised eggs are high in nutrients and should be a staple in every diet. But if they’re out of your budget, cage-free and free-range eggs remain a great option.</p>"}
