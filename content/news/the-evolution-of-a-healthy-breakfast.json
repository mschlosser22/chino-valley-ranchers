There’s never been a standard definition of what a “healthy breakfast” is, since the definition of “healthy” means different things to different people. For some, “healthy” can mean that a food is high in fiber, meatless, organic or local. Others are like us at Chino Valley Ranchers, who demand non-GMO, antibiotic-free or sustainably-raised foods on their plate. <!--more--></p>\n<p>Nowadays, more consumers are going for balance, while making sure the food helps them feel good emotionally and physically. Plus, the definition of healthy isn’t just based on nutrition anymore. Sure, a food item can be low in fat or high in protein, but people are now conscious of where an item is produced, as well as its impact on the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This approach to food began when organic foods started gaining traction and is now impacting the way restaurants use ingredients. According to the <a href=\"https://www.hartman-group.com/hartbeat/612/10-takeaways-from-evolving-culture-of-food-beverage-austin-2015\">Hartman Group</a>, farm-to-table attributes like fresh eggs, natural maple syrup, real butter and locally-grown produce make the biggest impact on menus, with 55 percent of consumers choosing “fresh” as being the most important factor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a <a href=\"https://www.smuckerawayfromhome.com/assets/pdf/Smuckers%20Breakfast%20Brief%20-%20Non-Meat%20Proteins.pdf\">survey</a> conducted by Technomic showed that 75 percent of people perceive foods high in protein, such as eggs, as being healthier and 39 percent are willing to pay extra for it. According to <a href=\"http://www.aeb.org/news-trends/incredible-breakfast-trends/simply-nutritious/leaning-toward-leaner-protein\">Datassential</a>, the number of restaurants that feature egg whites on their menus has risen 32 percent since 2009. As this demand continues to increase, more restaurants will be pushed to creatively expand their menus to provide healthful eating.</p>\n<p>Here at Chino Valley Ranchers, we understand the exact components that make up each and every egg we sell.
