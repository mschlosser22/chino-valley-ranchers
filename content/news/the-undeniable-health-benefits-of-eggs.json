Adding eggs to your diet will bring a host of health benefits.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>1. Excellent nutrient and mineral profile</strong></p><p>Did you know that the nutrients in a single fertilized egg cell are capable of creating an entire chick? Each egg contains vitamin B12, vitamin B2, vitamin A, vitamin B5, and selenium. An egg also contains trace amounts of calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, potassium, vitamin E, and folate. Before you go on an egg white diet, understand that the egg white only contains protein, while the egg yolk contains all the above-mentioned nutrients.</p><p><br><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Improve cholesterol levels</strong></p><p>We’ve all heard the warnings that eggs raise cholesterol. However, studies show eggs actually improve cholesterol levels. Eggs raise good cholesterol (HDL) and change the bad cholesterol (LDL) into a large subtype that isn’t strongly associated with an increased risk of heart disease.</p><p><br>In addition, eating three whole eggs per day can actually reduce insulin resistance, raise HDL, and increase the size of LDL particles in individuals with metabolic syndrome.</p><p><br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Choline-dense</strong></p><p>Choline is a component of cell membranes and a nutrient that helps synthesize the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Low choline intake may increase the risk of liver disease, neurological disorders, and heart disease. Consuming one large egg will provide 113 mg of choline.</p><p><br><strong>4. Perfect amino acid profile</strong></p><p>The body needs 21 amino acids to build proteins, and nine of them can’t be produced by the body. These nine amino acids are called essential amino acids because they must be obtained from diet. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, which have a perfect score of 100 when compared to other protein sources.</p><p><strong><br>5. Eye protection power</strong></p><p>Eggs contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which are two antioxidants that protect the eyes. Both of these antioxidants are contained in the yolk and help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Support fat loss</strong></p><p>Eggs are high on the satiety index, which is a measure of how satiated an individual feels after eating a particular food. For this reason, eating eggs for breakfast can lead to fat loss. So go right ahead and treat yourself to your favorite egg recipe — using Chino Valley Ranchers eggs, of course!</p>"}
