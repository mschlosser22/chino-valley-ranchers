Once that is done, peel the eggs and cut them in half. Separate the yolks from the eggs and place them in a food processor.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Whip it up.</strong></p>\n<p>Add mayonnaise, watercress, scallions, and tarragon to the egg yolks in the food processor. Allow the processor to pulse until you have the desired texture. Be careful not to over-process the mixture, or else it will have trouble staying in place (and on your plate!). For some extra flavor, add salt and pepper.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Add ham.</strong></p>\n<p>Roll up pieces of sliced ham and place them in each egg. A little portion of the yolk mixture can be added to the center of the egg to help hold the ham in place. Gently press in the ham and then add another layer of the yolk mixture over the egg.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Serve and enjoy!</strong></p>\n<p>The eggs can be served immediately or chilled for at least one or two hours before serving. Either way, you’ll have a tasty spring-inspired dish ready to serve!</p>\n<p>We at Chino Valley Ranchers know that our customers deserve the best, which means both the freshest ingredients and the tastiest of recipes.
