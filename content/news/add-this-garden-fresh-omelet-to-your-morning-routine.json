Prepare your vegetables.<br />\n</strong>Wash your mushrooms, red peppers and spinach. Then, add a small amount of water to a skillet, place it on the stove and set it to a medium heat. Once that is done, add the mushrooms, peppers, and spinach to the pan and make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the pan. Then, mix all the vegetables for approximately one minute. To add some flavor, sprinkle in some salt and pepper. Take the vegetables out of the skillet and place them on a heatproof dish.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1895\" src=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.png\" alt=\"1\" width=\"410\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.png 1147w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1-768x503.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>2. Pour your egg whites.<br />\n</strong>Coat your empty skillet with a small amount of olive oil, and make sure that it is evenly applied over the entire skillet. Pour one carton of Chino Valley Ranchers’ Cage-Free Egg Whites into the skillet, and allow the egg whites to cook until it can be separated from the sides of the pan. Feel free to add some salt and pepper as well.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1896\" src=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.png\" alt=\"2\" width=\"405\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.png 1144w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-768x506.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3. Put the finishing touches on your omelet.<br />\n</strong>While the egg whites continue to cook, place the vegetables back into the pan, trying to evenly distribute the mix of vegetables over the egg whites. Finally, take the omelet off the skillet and put it on a plate, folding the cooked egg whites over.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1898\" src=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4.png\" alt=\"4\" width=\"406\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4.png 1152w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4-768x511.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1897\" src=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.png\" alt=\"3\" width=\"407\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.png 1150w, https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-768x508.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" /></p>\n<p>And that’s it!
