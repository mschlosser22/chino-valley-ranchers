Whether they are in a breakfast sandwich or a simple salad, they never seem to disappoint. With something so yummy and healthy, have you ever wondered what exactly is in an egg? At Chino Valley Ranchers, we know everything there is to know about eggs from the inside out. <!--more-->Take a look at what exactly makes up an egg with our egg anatomy lesson:</p>\n<p><u>The Shell</u></p>\n<p>Acting as the egg’s exterior surface, the eggshell is made almost completely out of calcium carbonate crystals. The shell plays an important role in making sure that bacteria, dust and other particles don’t enter the egg and damage its interior.</p>\n<p><u>The Yolk</u></p>\n<p>Known as one of the more iconic parts of an egg, the yolk consists of different minerals and vitamins that can keep us healthy. These include, but are not limited to: vitamin A, vitamin D, iron, calcium, etc. While the color of the yolk might vary from light yellow to dark orange, don’t let that worry you. The color of the yolk differs depending on the hen breed and what the hen is fed.</p>\n<p><u>The Egg White</u></p>\n<p>Also known as <em>albumen</em>, the egg white heavily consists of water and contains the majority of an egg’s protein. It is also very rich in minerals and happens to be fat-free.</p>\n<p><u>The Chalaza</u></p>\n<p>Chalazae look like small ropes that serve the purpose of holding the yolk in place. They are also an indicator of how fresh an egg is. The easier you can see them, the fresher the eggs are.</p>\n<p>Knowing what makes up an egg can help you find and pick the freshest eggs out there.
