Many consumers are choosing organic eggs over conventional eggs, but most don’t know what it takes to actually produce organic eggs. Here are just a few requirements Chino Valley Ranchers follows to produce organic eggs.</p><p><br><strong>Feed</strong></p><p>Eggs certified USDA organic were produced by chickens fed 100% organic feed. Chickens may also receive vitamin and mineral supplements. Chino Valley Ranchers chickens receive a precise feed formulation that contains the finest grains, such as top grade corn, soybean, alfalfa, flax seed, and limestone and other essential minerals. Our chickens don’t consume any hormones, antibiotics, or animal by-products, ensuring they produce healthy and organic eggs.</p><p><br><strong>Preventive management</strong></p><p>Preventive management involves health care for sick or injured animals. To receive the orgnaic label, chickens may not be treated with a substance that isn’t labeled organic. At Chino Valley Ranchers, we take chicken health seriously and closely monitor our hens for signs of illness.</p><p><br><strong>Pasture grazing</strong></p><p>Chino Valley Ranchers pasture raised farms provide 108 square feet of pasture for each hen, which equals one full acre for every 400 hens. To be certified organic, chickens must spend at least 120 days of grazing on pastures. In addition, chickens must receive at least 30 percent of their feed from pasture.</p><p><br><strong>Access to the outdoors</strong></p><p>Organic chickens must have year-round access to the outdoors and may only be temporarily confined indoors due to documented environmental or health considerations.</p><p><br><strong>Why We Take Organic Seriously</strong></p><p>For over 30 years, Chino Valley Ranchers has been a leading provider of organic eggs to Southern California residents. Our organic eggs don’t contain any preservatives, antibiotics, or growth hormones. In addition, our chickens consume a GMO-free feed that doesn’t contain any chemicals.</p><p><br>Chino Valley Ranchers is a California Certified Organic Farmer proud to operate Southern California’s only certified organic feed mill.
