Perfect your egg poaching skills with the following tips, the next time you’re cooking with eggs.<br></p><ol><li><p><strong>Use fresh eggs.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Rule #1: Always use fresh eggs. Check the carton for the expiration date before making a purchase.</p><p></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Wait until the water stops boiling.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Once you’ve brought the water to a boil, remove the pot from the stove and reduce heat. Wait until the water is gently simmering and carefully lower the egg into the pot. Placing the egg into boiling water could cause it to break apart.</p><p></p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Use vinegar.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Just one tablespoon of vinegar in the pot of boiling water will help the egg maintain its form while poaching. The egg whites will cook faster and you’ll have a beautiful poached egg.</p><p></p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Use a small bowl.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Before dropping the egg into hot water, crack it into a small bowl or ramekin to help it keep its shape while poaching.<br></p><ol start=\"5\"><li><p><strong>Stir the water.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Stir the water with a spoon a few times before putting the egg in water to create a vortex that will help the egg white wrap around the yolk.</p><p></p><ol start=\"6\"><li><p><strong>Avoid overcrowding.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Avoid poaching more than two to three eggs at a time. Too many eggs in the pot could cause the eggs to collide and break apart.</p><p></p><ol start=\"7\"><li><p><strong>Don’t overcook.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Don’t cook the egg for more than three minutes or you’ll risk a hard yolk. A perfect poached egg has a soft, runny yolk.</p><p></p><ol start=\"8\"><li><p><strong>Try a soup ladle.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Coat a soup ladle with cooking spray, crack the egg in, and lower the ladle into simmering water until the egg is fully formed.</p><p></p><ol start=\"9\"><li><p><strong>Use an Instant Pot.</strong></p></li></ol><p>An Instant Pot is a great way to quickly poach an egg. Simply coat the inside of a silicone egg cup with butter or cooking spray and crack the egg. Then, place the egg into the instant pot. Be sure to set a low pressure and quick release on the pot. Cook for six minutes and you’ve got the perfect poached egg!</p>"}
