Poach your eggs.</strong></p>\n<p>Fill a saucepan with water and place the pan on the stove until it simmers. Crack your eggs into individual bowls and then drop the eggs into the pot, one by one. Make sure that the eggs do not touch each other, as it will ruin the poaching process. Let the eggs cook for a few minutes and when they are ready, take each egg out of the water. For a cleaner look, feel free to trim the edges of the eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Heat your leftovers.</strong></p>\n<p>As your eggs are cooking, take your leftover turkey, stuffing and gravy and heat them all up separately. Season with salt and pepper for some extra flavor. If you prefer toasted bread, feel free to stick the bread in a toaster at this time as well.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Put it all together.</strong></p>\n<p>Place your bread on a plate. Then, scoop some cranberry sauce onto the bread. Next, add your heated stuffing and turkey. Finally, with your poached eggs completed, place the egg top of the turkey and drizzle gravy over it.</p>\n<p>And just like that, your eggs benedict with a thanksgiving twist is ready to go!
