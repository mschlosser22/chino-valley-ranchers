With up to seven grams of protein per egg, you will feel full and recharged by simply eating one by itself! But researchers are finding that eggs aren’t just useful for their protein benefits – they also help influence how other nutrients are absorbed in your body.<!--more--></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"effects%2520of%2520egg%2520consumption%2520on%2520carotenoid%2520absorption%2520from%2520co-consum%25E2%2580%25A6\">study</a> recently completed at Purdue University looked at the effects of dietary fats on the absorption of vitamin E. Vitamin E has been dubbed as a “super-vitamin” due to its ability to treat and prevent heart disease, high blood pressure, diseases of the nervous system and pregnancy complications. It is also known for its ability to help hair and skin look and shine its brightest. Vegetables like spinach and broccoli and nuts like almonds and pine nuts are great sources of vitamin E.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that vitamin E can be more easily absorbed if they are eaten with cooked eggs. Why? Vitamin E is fat-soluble, which means it is readily absorbed in the presence of fat. Since egg yolks naturally contain dietary fats, they have a strong influence on the uptake of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin E.
