Since 1950, they’ve been providing organic eggs to customers – long before the inception of the USDA Organic program.</p>\n<p>In his post, Rocchio highlights the key benefits of eggs laid by hens raised in cage-free environments. He shows how pasture raised eggs are lower in fat and naturally more nutritious because they contain more nutrients like vitamin A, E, D and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>\n<p>“I constantly hear that people still don’t have options at their local stores to buy eggs from pasture raised chickens, and therefore don’t get the extra nutrients and benefits they provide,” said Rocchio. “That’s why I’m always directing them towards eggs I recommend, such as pasture raised products from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chinovalleyranchers/\">Chino</a> Valley Ranchers.”</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://chrisrocchiofitness.wordpress.com/\">his site</a> and social media feeds, Rocchio regularly shares helpful tips for better fitness and healthier living to his 149,000+ followers.
