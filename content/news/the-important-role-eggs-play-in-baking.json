Believe it or not, the answer is not so easy to <em>whip up.</em> Because eggs are so <em>eggs-travagantly</em> multi-faceted, there are many uses for our beloved incredible, edible egg. Organic egg recipes both sweet and savory are easy to make and even easier to eat. From cakes to puddings, and custards to pies, eggs are a necessary part of baking. Here are some of the reasons why.<!--more--></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structure: We’ve all cooked a scrambled or fried egg, right? So then, we all know how with heat, they become firm. The same principle applies to baked eggs. Once they’re mixed into your batter and baked, they help set the structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leavening: Baking soda and baking powder aren’t the only way to give your baked goods some oomph. Oh, no. The mighty egg white traps air bubbles when it’s whisked all light and fluffy. The egg is then folded into a batter, holding its air and giving the baked good in question a nice, cloud-like puff.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Savory: Egg yolks have a high (good) fat content, which adds a rich flavor to baked goods.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Shiny and sparkly: When mixed with milk or water, egg whites can be used as an egg wash. Brush them onto the surface of breads, piecrusts, cookies, pretzels, biscuits, or even hamburger buns to give them a lovely sheen when baked.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Whites and yolks: Obviously they serve different purposes, but do you know what they are? In organic egg recipes, the white can serve as a leavener, the base for marshmallows, or part of icing. In addition, they are the main ingredients in the topping of meringue pies. The yolk, on the other hand, adds flavor and color to baked goods and works as a thickener. It is often used in custard-type treats such as crème brule and key lime pie.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we take raising our hens seriously. That’s why they’re only fed the best—an all-organic, vegetarian diet—and allowed ample space to take dust baths, peck the ground, and flap their wings.
