Prepare the tortillas.</strong><br />\nPreheat the oven to 350° F. Wrap your tortillas in foil and warm them in the oven. This should only take a few minutes, so keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t burn.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Cook the eggs.</strong><br />\nBring a skillet to medium heat, coat it with a small amount of vegetable oil and rack your Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs directly into it. If you’re unsure of how many eggs to use, usually one egg per wrap is enough. Scramble the eggs for a few minutes, making sure to stir frequently.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Make your wraps.</strong><br />\nGrabbing your warmed tortillas, separate and spoon your scrambled Chino Valley Ranchers eggs down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle each tortilla with cheese, sliced avocado, chopped tomato, chopped onion and chopped cilantro. Add fresh spinach, chopped dill, and sour cream. Make sure to leave room around the edges of each tortilla to make wrapping up a cinch.</p>\n<p>Want to make your breakfast wraps ahead of time? Simply cover your finished product with foil or plastic wrap and place them in the freezer. When you’re ready to eat them, remove the wrapper and either microwave for a few minutes or bake them at 350° F for seven minutes.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!
