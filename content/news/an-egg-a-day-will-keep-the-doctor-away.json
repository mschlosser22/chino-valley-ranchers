Yes, eggs can be high in cholesterol. There can be up to 200 milligrams in one large egg, and when compared to most other foods, that number seems outrageous. But just because food has high cholesterol does not always mean it will raise the bad levels of cholesterol in your system. Eggs are an incredible food to keep in your diet, and here is why.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>• Naturally Nutritious:</strong> One egg contains Vitamins A, B2, B5, B12, and Selenium in significant quantities. In smaller amounts, an egg contains just about every single vitamin and mineral that the human body needs to function. This includes calcium, Folate, iron, manganese, potassium, Vitamin E, and zinc. It is practically nature’s multivitamin!</p>\n<p><strong>• Clean Cholesterol:</strong> Cholesterol is generally the biggest reason people avoid eggs. But there are two kinds of cholesterol: HDL (the “good” cholesterol) and LDL (the “bad” cholesterol). Eating eggs raises your HDL and changes your LDL into a different subtype of cholesterol that is not related to heart problems.</p>\n<p><strong>• Big Brains:</strong> Eggs contain a lesser-known nutrient called Choline that is really healthy for your brain. It is essential for the cell membranes in your brain and can help prevent liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and multiple neurological problems. For pregnant women, Choline aids tube growth and helps the fetus’s cognitive function. And over 90% of people eat less than the daily recommended amount!</p>\n<p><strong>• Packed Protein:</strong> Eggs can help you lose body fat if you prepare them properly. There are very few carbohydrates in an egg, but it is packed with protein and healthy fat. The combination will keep you fuller, longer. But be sure not to add a ton of cream and cheese to your eggs or your weight loss will be hindered.</p>\n<p>Though eggs should definitely not be consumed for all three meals, it is a great start to your day to keep your body full and energized.
