For some, it is a personal choice to support farmers that produce eggs organically and humanely. To Chino Valley Ranchers, “cage free” means more than just letting birds out of cages, which is why we raise our birds in smaller flock sizes and never use aviaries. By doing this, we raise happy, healthy birds who provide quality eggs and egg products for our communities.</p>\n<p>Here are a few reasons why we are so passionate about producing the freshest and highest quality eggs.<!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>They’re Nutritious<br />\n</strong>With cage free eggs, you’re getting up to <a href=\"https://www.organicconsumers.org/scientific/free-range-eggs-contain-more-vitamin-d-according-mother-earth-news-study\">six times more vitamin D than conventional eggs</a>. They are packed with protein. In fact, each egg contains roughly 6 grams of protein. They contain about 40 different kinds of proteins that aid in metabolism, making them easy to digest.</li>\n<li><strong>They’re Happier<br />\n</strong>It’s easy to know that cage free chickens are happier than chickens that are stuck in their coop. If animal welfare is important to you, then going with cage free chickens is a great option. Also, be sure to steer clear of labeling that may be misleading. A Certified Humane label isn’t the same as free-range &#8211; this just means that chickens are in larger cages.</li>\n<li><strong>They Keep You Satiated<br />\n</strong>Cage free eggs have less than 100 calories per serving but are sure to keep you energized and satisfied throughout the day. Plus, they’re packed with healthy fats and proteins and are a great alternative to unhealthy snacking options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, our chickens have been cage-free since day one. The humane treatment of our chickens produces the freshest and highest quality eggs out there, and that is part of our mission. We work every day to ensure our chickens get high-quality feed and special roosting and nesting areas to produce delicious, organic eggs.</p>\n<p>To find a Chino Valley Ranchers distributor near you, visit our <a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">store locator!</a></p>\n"}
