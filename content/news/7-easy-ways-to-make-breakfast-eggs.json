If you’re looking for new ways to cook eggs for breakfast, here's a guide to seven delicious options.<br></p><ol><li><p><strong>Sunny-Side-Up Eggs</strong></p></li></ol><p>Begin by heating a non-stick skillet over low to medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil. Once the butter is melted and hot, crack an egg into the skillet, being careful not to break the yolk. As the egg cooks, the white should become firm while the yolk remains runny. For a perfectly smooth egg white, cover the skillet with a lid. Once cooked to your preference, season with salt and pepper, then serve.</p><p></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Over-Easy Eggs</strong></p></li></ol><p>As with sunny-side-up eggs, start by heating a non-stick skillet with some butter or oil over medium heat. Then, crack the egg into the skillet. After a minute or so, when the white is set but the yolk is still runny, carefully flip the egg using a spatula. Let it cook for another minute or less (being careful to keep the yolk runny), then serve.<br></p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Eggs-in-a-Basket</strong></p></li></ol><p>Using a cookie cutter or a glass, make a hole in the center of a slice of bread. Then, place the bread into a heated skillet with melted butter. Crack an egg into the hole and cook until the bread is golden brown. Then flip to cook the other side. Once done, you'll have a delicious combination of crispy bread and a perfectly cooked egg.<br></p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Scrambled Eggs</strong></p></li></ol><p>Whisk together eggs with a dash of milk or cream. Heat a pan with butter over low to medium heat and pour in the egg mixture, stirring constantly using a spatula. The key is to cook the eggs slowly, so they remain soft and creamy. Once they've achieved a soft curd-like consistency, season with salt, pepper, and some herbs or cheese, if desired.</p><p></p><ol start=\"5\"><li><p><strong>Omelet</strong></p></li></ol><p>Whisk eggs and pour them into a hot, buttered non-stick skillet. Swirl the eggs around the pan and let them set. Once they start to firm up but are still slightly runny in the middle, add fillings like cheese, vegetables, or meats to one half. Carefully fold the other half over the fillings and continue to cook until done.</p><p></p><ol start=\"6\"><li><p><strong>Frittata</strong></p></li></ol><p>Think of a frittata as a thicker, oven-finished omelet. Begin by sautéing fillings like sausage, mushrooms, or vegetables in an oven-safe skillet. Pour whisked eggs over the fillings, and cook until the edges start to set. Then transfer the skillet to an oven, preheated to around 350°F (175°C), and bake until the eggs are set in the center.</p><p></p><ol start=\"7\"><li><p><strong>Poached Eggs</strong></p></li></ol><p>Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer and add a touch of vinegar. Crack an egg into a small bowl. Create a whirlpool in the simmering water using a spoon, and gently slide the egg into the center of the whirlpool. The swirling water helps the egg white wrap around the yolk. Cook for about 4 minutes for a soft yolk, then remove with a slotted spoon.<br></p>"}
