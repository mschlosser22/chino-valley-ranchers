Here at Chino Valley Ranchers, we’ve got some egg-cellent advice to help you decide!<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Cut the Heat, Taste the Nutrients<br />\n</strong>When selecting how to prepare your eggs, our first suggestion is to choose a shorter, lower heat cooking method. While eggs are always healthy, these methods help the eggs retain the most possible nutrients. For this reason, we recommend trying scrambled, hard-boiled or soft-boiled eggs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hard-Boiled: </strong>If you’re looking for a simple snack, hard-boiled eggs are for you. They preserve the entire egg, making them easy to eat and all-around delicious!</li>\n<li><strong>Soft-Boiled: </strong>Just like hard boiled eggs, soft-boiled eggs are low-fat and save the entire egg as well. However, these eggs pack the most nutrients out of all the different types of egg servings. Soft-boiled eggs combine the best of poached eggs and hard-boiled eggs, as the yolk in soft-boiled eggs remains runny.</li>\n<li><strong>Scrambled eggs:</strong> This preparation of an egg is delicious because the hydrating water added during cooking helps make them light and fluffy. You get the nutritional benefits from both the egg yolk and the egg white. The fast cooking time is both efficient for quenching your hunger and preserving nutrients as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hold the Yolk<br />\n</strong>Egg whites are a great low-calorie option. A serving of egg whites has 3 grams of protein, which is the same amount of protein found in a serving of egg yolk. However, a serving of egg whites is only around 15 calories, while egg yolk is closer to 60.</p>\n<p>No matter how you like your eggs, you’ll love the nutritional benefits of consuming Chino Valley Ranchers’ organic eggs.
