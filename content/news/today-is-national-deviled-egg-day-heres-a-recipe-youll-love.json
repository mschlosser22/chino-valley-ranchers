We’ve found that a perfectly boiled egg takes 12 minutes to boil. There is no need to bring your eggs to room temperature; you can start cooking them straight from the fridge. The water should naturally reduce to a simmer, due to the addition of cold eggs, but make sure to maintain the simmer for about 12 minutes.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Prepare your filling.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the 12 minutes are up, remove the eggs from the hot water and allow them to cool in a bowl of ice water. Peel your eggs, cut them in half (length-wise) and scoop the yolks into a medium bowl. Add enough mayonnaise to create a creamy consistency, and mash in a bit of mustard. Then, sprinkle in some salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Assemble your deviled eggs.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, fill your empty egg whites evenly with the yolk mixture. Add paprika for a nice but deviled garnish. Enjoy right away or cover and store in the refrigerator for your evening get-together!</p>\n<p>Deviled eggs have a delightful amount of options for you to top them off with. Bacon is always a classic, and paprika is practically a staple. But, don’t let that stop you! Cheese, anchovies, sour cream, onion, caviar, olives &#8211; all these delectable ingredients can be added to your deviled eggs.</p>\n<p>Make sure to have your deviled eggs stand out by using organic, grass-fed Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs located at <a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/store-locator/\">a store near you</a>.
