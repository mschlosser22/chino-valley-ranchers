Keep reading for this tasty Paleo-friendly breakfast.</p>\n<p><u>What You’ll Need</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs</li>\n<li>Hass avocados</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Optional Ingredients</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salt</li>\n<li>Pepper</li>\n<li>Chopped chives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Begin by preheating your oven to 425°F. While your oven preheats, slice your avocados in half longitudinally. Remove the pit and begin scooping out about two tablespoons of the avocado flesh from the center of where the pit was. You’ll want to make enough room for the egg to fit comfortably in it without overflowing.</p>\n<p>Next, place your avocados in a small baking dish. If they fail to stay upright, try slicing a piece from the bottom of the avocado to create a stand. Then, crack a Chino Valley Ranchers egg into each avocado half. Try your best to crack the yolk in first, then let the egg whites spill in to fill up the rest of the shell.</p>\n<p>Place your avocado eggs in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. The cooking time will depend on the size of your avocados and eggs. Once the time is up, remove your avocado eggs from the oven and let them sit for a bit, just to make sure that the egg whites have had enough time to set. Season with salt, pepper, and chives and enjoy!</p>\n<p>There you have it &#8211; a Chino Valley Ranchers breakfast favorite!
