The egg yolk helps heal and moisturize damaged hair while the white sticks to dirt and helps remove it.</li>\n<li>Whether you need to moisturize your skin or help soothe wrinkles, eggs can come to the rescue. Egg whites tighten the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Egg yolks, on the other hand, moisturize dry skin.</li>\n<li>Arts and crafts. Most famously known for their ability to be dyed and decorated around Easter time, eggs can be used in other creative ways. Using a small pin, prick a hole on one side of the egg and allow the white and yolk to drain out. Decorate the eggshell to your liking.</li>\n<li>Enhance coffee.
