When it’s nice and dry, scrub it off using warm water. Pat dry with a towel.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><strong>Hydrating organic egg mask recipe: </strong></h4>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<p>1 egg white</p>\n<p>¼ ripe avocado (hydrates skin)</p>\n<p>1 teaspoon of yogurt (eliminates bacteria)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mash the avocado with a fork until it’s nice and smooth (think lump free). Add the egg white and yogurt; mix well.</li>\n<li>Clean your face with warm water and pat dry. Apply the organic egg recipe to your face using clean fingers or a cotton ball. Let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Wash the mixture off with lukewarm water (hot water dries skin out).
