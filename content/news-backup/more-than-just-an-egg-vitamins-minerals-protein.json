You’ve got the shell, the white and the yolk. But there’s more than you might expect all wrapped up in that simple-looking treat.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we produce nutritious egg products because we know that eggs can be a great addition to your diet. They are inexpensive, an excellent source of protein and can help improve your overall health. But these aren’t the only positive aspects to eating eggs.</p>\n<p>Here are four more reasons why eggs are among the healthiest foods you can eat.<!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Quality protein<br />\n</strong>According to the <a href=\"https://www.eggnutritioncenter.org/\">American Egg Board</a>, the protein that’s found in eggs is the highest quality of protein that can be found in any food. It’s also one of the least expensive ways that you can get your protein as well, with about six grams of protein in each large egg.</li>\n<li><strong>Weight control<br />\n</strong>If you’re trying to lose weight, this is great news for you. The high-quality protein found in eggs helps keep you feeling full and gives you the energy you need to power through your day. And the best part? Eggs also actually taste great!</li>\n<li><strong>Improved memory<br />\n</strong>Eggs also contain choline, a nutrient that helps support brain function. It works to maintain the structure of the cell membranes in the brain, which are responsible for relaying signals from your nerves to your muscles.</li>\n<li><strong>Eye protection<br />\n</strong>Not only are they good for your brain, but eggs are also good for your eyes. The yolk of eggs contains lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoids that help fend off macular degeneration. These antioxidants have also been associated with decreasing the likelihood of cataract development.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/egg-facts/\">The natural nutrition</a> in eggs can’t be beaten.
