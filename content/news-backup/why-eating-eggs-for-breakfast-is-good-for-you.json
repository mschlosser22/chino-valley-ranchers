And though at times it may be hard even for you to resist the temptation, here are a few reasons why you should start your breakfast on a healthy note — with eggs.</span><!--more--></p>\n<p><b>1. They’re packed with nutrition.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They might be small, but don’t underestimate how much nutrition they’ve got inside. One large hard-boiled egg has:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six grams of protein</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five grams of healthy fats</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitamins A, B5, B6, B12, D, E, K</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choline</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folate</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phosphorus</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selenium</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calcium</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zinc</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>2. They raise good cholesterol.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, help lower the risk of heart disease, stroke and other health issues. One study found that eating two eggs a day for six weeks increased HDL levels by 10%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though eggs are high in cholesterol, consider what the research says before cutting eggs out of your diet. One study found that eggs don’t raise cholesterol at all for about 70% of people. In addition, cholesterol in the diet doesn’t necessarily raise cholesterol in the blood.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. They’re good for your metabolism.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One hard-boiled egg has about 147 mg of choline, which is 27% of how much you should be consuming in one day. Choline helps the body:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make fats that support cell structure</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Produce compounds that act as cell messengers</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a substance required for removing cholesterol from your liver</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go through DNA synthesis</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain a healthy nervous system by supporting memory, muscle movement, regular heartbeat and other functions</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>4. They’re good for your eyesight.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Egg yolks contain large amounts of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts in the eyes. The Vitamin A contained in eggs also supports eye health.</span></p>\n<p><b>5. They help your body absorb more vitamins.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study found that adding an egg to salad can help the body absorb </span><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/11/2199/4584690\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more vitamin E</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from raw vegetables.</span></p>\n<p><b>6. They’re filling.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because eggs are high in protein, they’re naturally filling. This might explain why you don’t feel full after eating a whole bag of Doritos and a giant slice of chocolate cake for breakfast. </span></p>\n"}
