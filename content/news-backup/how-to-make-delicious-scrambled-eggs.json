Whether preferred sunny side up, poached, boiled, baked, or scrambled, there’s a choice for everyone. Here is a delicious organic egg recipe: scrambled eggs. We know, we know. A recipe for scrambled eggs? Yes, believe it or not, there is a right and a wrong way to make them.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Here are some tips for <em>eggs-travagant</em> scrambled eggs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start with organic eggs.</strong> At Chino Valley Ranchers, we think that all food should be locally sourced and organic, but especially when a recipe has only one or two ingredients. You will taste the difference. We promise.</li>\n<li><strong>Whip it up.</strong> Using a whisk and some elbow grease, whip those eggs until the white and yellow are blended. For extra fluffiness, use an immersion blender. It adds a little bit of air into the eggs. Yum. Now is also the time to season eggs with a little bit of salt.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind the heat.</strong> We repeat: mind the heat. Keep your stove at medium-low. If the heat is too high, the eggs will be dry and tough; too low and they’ll be soft and mushy.</li>\n<li><strong>Bust out the butter.</strong> You could use oil, but butter just tastes better. Plus it helps keep the eggs moist.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For this organic egg recipe, heat your skillet (medium-low, people, medium-low). Once it’s heated, add a dollop of butter and let it melt. Next, add the eggs and let them sit for a few seconds. That’s it! Use a spatula to push the eggs from one side of the skillet to the other. Push, move, push, move, but don’t scramble, chop, or hack. Sweep the spatula around the edges as necessary. You want to get all of the egg-y goodness into your scramble. Continue to do this until the eggs are almost completely cooked. Transfer to a plate (the eggs will finish cooking from skillet to plate). Add more salt and pepper if necessary and enjoy!</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, we pride ourselves on harvesting only the best organic eggs.
