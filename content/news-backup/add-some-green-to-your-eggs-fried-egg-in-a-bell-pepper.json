Continue reading for the full recipe and enjoy trying it yourself!</p>\n<p><u>What You’ll Need:</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chino Valley Ranchers eggs</li>\n<li>Bell pepper</li>\n<li>Tomato</li>\n<li>Salt</li>\n<li>Pepper</li>\n<li>Butter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1. Prepare the bell pepper.</strong></p>\n<p>When selecting your bell pepper, make sure it is on the larger side, as it has to be big enough to fit an egg and a tomato inside. With your bell pepper chosen, start by rinsing the vegetable and then removing its stem and seeds. From there, cut out 1/3–inch rings. These rings will act as the perimeter of the dish. Then, take out a skillet, grease it with butter, place the bell pepper rings on top of it and let them fry for about three minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Time for tomatoes.</strong></p>\n<p>Slice thin circles of a tomato and place one slice in the middle of each frying bell pepper. Feel free to season the vegetables with salt as they cook.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Crack your eggs.</strong></p>\n<p>The last – and in our opinion the most important – ingredient to this dish is the egg! Crack open and place a Chino Valley Ranchers egg in each bell pepper ring. Add salt and pepper and let it fry until it is cooked to your liking.</p>\n<p>When the eggs are done cooking, remove them from the pan and serve them with a side of toast or bacon.
