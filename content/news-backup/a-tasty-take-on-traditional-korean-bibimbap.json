In a medium bowl, mix 3:1:3 parts rice vinegar, salt, and water into a shallow bowl and soak the red pepper slices in the brine for at least 30 minutes. Drain them completely and make sure they are dry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, line a baking tray with nonstick foil. In a separate bowl, coat about two cups of sweet potato with equal parts miso paste and sesame oil, and roast for 10 minutes. Move the potatoes around and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. When they are done, set the potatoes aside and let cool to room temperature.</p>\n<p>In a separate pan over medium heat, sauté equal parts of shiitake mushrooms, baby kale and baby spinach with some sesame oil. Once the greens are wilted, mix with sesame seeds and set aside.</p>\n<p>To assemble your bibimbap bowls, fill the bottom with rice and arrange the other prepared ingredients on top. Be as creative as you’d like with the presentation!</p>\n<p>Now for the best part, the fried Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs. Heat some olive oil in a small pan and pour in your eggs once the oil is hot. Fry them until the egg whites are cooked through. Place one fried egg on top of each bibimbap bowl and top it off with an extra dollop of red chili paste. Feel free to customize your own bibimbap bowls with ingredients like your favorite meats, seafood, pickled carrots, red cabbage, bean sprouts or cucumber.</p>\n<p>Once it is all assembled, you can finally dig in and enjoy one of the most delicious and healthy meals around!
