Nowadays, more and more people are moving towards intentional eating, which means focusing more on how dining choices affect their own health as well as that of the planet.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Eating natural, minimally-processed, local foods is a practice that many nutritionists preach to the public to do. Most Americans don’t consume enough vegetables; only <a href=\"https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/americans-don-t-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables-cdc-finds-t118925\">12 percent</a> are eating the recommended 1.5-2 cups per day! In response, more food services have started to take a “veggie-forward” approach by making vegetables the center of the plate.</p>\n<p>As veggies continue to gain popularity, so are eggs. According to <a href=\"http://www.aeb.org/news-trends/incredible-breakfast-trends/make-room-for-veggies/veggies-take-center-stage\">Technomic</a>, eggs are one of the top protein choices, and 66 percent of people would likely substitute eggs for other proteins like ham or turkey. Combine eggs and veggies together, and you have a dynamic food duo. Veggies and eggs have always been friends, often served together in salads, sandwiches, scrambles – you name it. Plus, <a href=\"http://www.chinovalleyranchers.com/having-a-salad-add-an-egg-to-increase-your-vitamin-e-intake/\">studies have shown</a> that when consuming vegetables with protein, nutrients like vitamin E are more readily absorbed in the gut.</p>\n<p>Eggs are the talk of the town when it comes to satisfying both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Aside from their convenience, eggs are packed with protein and flavor. If you’re not convinced, here are some other reasons why we at Chino Valley Ranchers love eggs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Like veggies, eggs are natural and unprocessed</li>\n<li>They’re nutrient-dense – each egg has 6 grams of protein!</li>\n<li>Eggs make perfect add-ons and can serve as binders and toppings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As veggie-based dishes continue to rise and find their place in both food services and homes, the addition of eggs changes the protein game and creates a match made in food heaven.</p>\n<p>Chino Valley Ranchers is all about holism and sustainability. We want to make sure that you have a healthy and well-balanced diet, which is why providing our customers with nutrient-dense egg products is important to us.
