After the kids tear open their presents and you spend an hour trying to free their toys from the packaging <!--more-->(you might need the jaws of life to do so…seriously!) while buried underneath a mound of ribbon and wrapping paper, whip up one of these <em>egg-cellent</em> Christmas morning breakfasts with some healthy organic eggs. After they eat all the candy that Santa left them, the kids will be happy to have something nourishing on the table.</p>\n<p>SEE ALSO: <a href=\"http://chinovalleyranchers.com/blog/how-to-make-delicious-scrambled-eggs/\">How to Make Delicious Scrambled Eggs</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-ham-and-cheese-breakfas-43364\">Fancy “ham and cheese” breakfast casserole</a>. Full of flavorful pancetta, bread, rich herbs, and Gruyere cheese, this dish is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Better yet, you make it the night before, allowing the bread to soak up the milk and egg mixture. Just pop it in the oven in the morning and it’ll be ready just about the time everyone realizes they’re starving.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-sweet-potato-and-spinach-breakfast-strata-recipes-from-the-kitchn-211481\">Sweet potato and spinach breakfast strata</a>. This one’s got a bit of everything: sweet potatoes, spinach, onions, sourdough bread, fontina cheese (yum!), organic eggs, and savory herbs. And just like our friend the “ham and cheese” casserole, it gets prepped the night before and popped into the oven in the morning. Heat the oven up when the kids come downstairs, pop it in when they start opening presents, and it’ll be ready by the time you wrestle the toys from their packaging.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/holiday-recipe-eggnog-breakfast-bread-pudding-recipes-from-the-kitchn-197305\">Eggnog breakfast bread pudding</a>. Oh my. Just the name sounds appetizing. French bread, butter, sugar, bourbon and warm maple syrup come together to create this sweet treat. Maybe we’re diverting from our “nourishing” breakfast dish here, but this sounds amazing. Plus it does call for 5 large organic eggs and 4 egg yolks, so there is something nutritious in it! This one is definitely for a more experienced or adventurous cook, but we think it will be worth the effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SEE ALSO: <a href=\"http://chinovalleyranchers.com/blog/quick-and-easy-organic-egg-recipes-for-breakfast/\">Quick and Easy Organic Egg Recipes for Breakfast</a></p>\n<p>We hope that you and your family have a very happy holiday season!
