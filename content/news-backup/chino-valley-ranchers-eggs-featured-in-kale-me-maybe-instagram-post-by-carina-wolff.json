The Toasted Whole Wheat Sourdough Avocado Toast recipe includes two fried Chino Valley Ranchers eggs.</span><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Instagram post, Carina says, “As you guys might know, I always opt for pasture-raised eggs. Why? Pasture-raised eggs come from chickens that are allowed the most space — far more than cage free or free range. Happy chickens = better eggs, as you can see from their bright yolk &amp; taste in their rich flavor.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On her Instagram profile, Carina shares recipes for toast, entrees, desserts, soups, salads, bowls, wraps and beverages, reaching 180,000 followers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President of Chino Valley Ranchers, Chris Nichols, says, “I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of toast with organic, pasture-raised eggs for breakfast. Healthy eating is never boring and I’m excited to try Carina’s recipe!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On her website, Carina writes, “My passion lies in educating people about eating well, so I started Kale Me Maybe to help share this knowledge and creativity with others.” She goes on to say, “My philosophy on healthy eating is that it’s a lifestyle, and not one that is created overnight. My food is meant to inspire you to eat the types of foods that give you the most benefits, but in the hopes that you will also crave them and enjoy not only eating them, but making them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the full Instagram post, visit </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx-Qz26p77C/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx-Qz26p77C/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit Carina’s blog at </span><a href=\"http://www.kalememaybe.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.kalememaybe.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n"}
