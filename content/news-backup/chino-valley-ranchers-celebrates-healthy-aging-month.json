It’s time to get back on the health train before it’s 2019. A healthy diet can be a key component to living a longer and better life. In honor of Healthy Aging Month, we at Chino Valley Ranchers wanted to share our five favorite ways that eating eggs can keep you healthy and feeling young.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>1. Eggs give you energy.<br />\n</strong>Do you ever feel like you’re ready for bed and then realize it’s only two in the afternoon? We’ve all felt that after-lunch slump, but when you eat Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs, you can say goodbye to that feeling! Eggs are packed with natural energy and are a good source of protein and healthy fats. Your body will create its own energy, rather than relying on being fed artificial ingredients from unhealthy energy drinks or sugary sodas.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Eggs give you brain power.<br />\n</strong>Many people worry they’ll lose their cognitive abilities as they grow older and fear developing conditions such as Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease or Dementia. Did you know that incorporating eggs into your diet can give you an edge up? This is because eggs contain choline, a nutrient that the brain needs to function. Studies have revealed that eating eggs frequently is associated with improved cognitive performance in older adults. Research also suggests that eggs can reduce the risk of stroke, and the excessive brain damage that can accompany strokes, in older adults by 12 percent.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Eggs keep you strong.<br />\n</strong>Eggs are one of the few foods that contain a significant amount of vitamin D, which is necessary for keeping bones strong and your body ready for action. Research also shows that a lifestyle that combines frequent exercise and protein intake can minimize frailty and the risk of being injured by a fall. Luckily, Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs are packed full of protein, so you are already half way there!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Eggs can show you the world.<br />\n</strong>Our eyesight deteriorates as we get older, but eggs can help minimize the effects. Egg yolks contain important antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin. These nutrients help to reduce the risk of developing cataracts and slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, which entails loss of vision, blurred vision and the inability to see in dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Eggs help you lose weight.<br />\n</strong>Eating eggs is one diet trend that actually works! <a href=\"https://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2018/04/17/heartjnl-2017-312651\">A recent study</a> compared people who ate eggs for breakfast against people who didn’t. It showed that the people who ate eggs lost 65 percent more weight and noticed an increase in energy. Maintaining a healthy weight as we age is important for self-confidence and preventing obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>\n<p>Join Chino Valley Ranchers this month in celebrating Healthy Aging Month!
