Prepare the filling.</strong></p>\n<p>Lightly butter a small baking dish and set it aside. In a sauté pan, heat up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms, making sure to stir frequently until they become golden. Transfer your mushrooms to a separate bowl and set it aside to let it cool completely.</p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together one-part milk to one-part Chino Valley Ranchers’ eggs and spice it up with salt, pepper, chopped dill and Dijon mustard. Then, set your mixture aside.</p>\n<p>In your prepared baking dish, toss the baguette cubes with half-part mozzarella cheese and the cooled mushrooms. Pour the egg mixture over the strata and top it off with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese. Cover the baking dish and place it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to allow for the bread to absorb the custard.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ready, set, bake.</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re ready to eat your strata, remove it from the fridge and let it come to room temperature. Set the oven to 350° F and bake the strata, uncovered, until it’s golden brown and puffy, which takes about 50 minutes. If you notice the top starting to brown too much, cover it lightly with foil. Once it’s done baking, allow your strata to set for 5 minutes and enjoy!</p>\n<p>There you have it – a Chino Valley Ranchers’ brunch recipe to satisfy any group!
