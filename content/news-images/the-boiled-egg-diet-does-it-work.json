We’ve had the keto diet, the whole 30 diet, the paleo diet, the low-carb diet, the Atkins diet, and the HCG diet, all promising to be the revolutionary way of eating we’ve all been desperately searching for. But if you’ve given up on all of these, then maybe the boiled egg diet could be the answer to all of your dieting dreams. Or maybe . . . not? </span><!--more--></p>\n<p><b>What is the Boiled Egg Diet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This diet basically involves eating multiple eggs or another type of lean protein and non-starchy vegetables with every meal, and one to two servings of low carb fruits per day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the rules of the diet:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least two eggs for breakfast + one serving of a non-starchy vegetable + one low carb fruit</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For lunch and dinner, you’ll have non-starchy vegetables + eggs or a small serving of a lean protein</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise is not required but encouraged</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No snacking between meals</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No sugar-sweetened beverages</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No processed foods</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The boiled egg diet lasts a few weeks and is not meant to permanently replace your daily diet.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Pros and Cons</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the diet is low on calories and carbs, dieters will likely lose weight. But once the diet is over, the weight may be quickly regained — the drawback of pretty much all diets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vegetables, lean proteins, eggs and fruits included in the diet are rich in many vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, offering many health benefits. Another benefit of the boiled egg diet is the lack of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main drawback of the boiled egg diet is how restrictive it is. Foods like grains, starchy vegetables and dairy contain certain vitamins and minerals not found in the foods that are allowed in the diet. Another drawback is that prolonged calorie restriction can cause low energy levels, decreased bone density, impaired immune function and menstrual disturbances.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though we would love it if everyone ate Chino Valley Ranchers eggs every day, the science clearly shows that what’s best for the human body is a healthy and balanced diet. So go ahead and eat eggs on a regular basis, but don’t forget to add in the vegetables, fruits and whole grains.</span></p>\n"}
