The consumer demand is growing quickly, but you might be asking yourself, what exactly is a “Veg-a-Fed” egg?<!--more--></p>\n<p>In the simplest of terms, it means that the hens laying these eggs are being fed a strictly vegetarian diet. Chickens are naturally omnivorous, as they are known to eat worms, insects and other small animals. Most standard chicken feeds will include animal byproducts as well.</p>\n<p>Studies show that a vegetarian diet can remove animal-based cholesterol from the hen’s systems and also eliminate the risks of any diseases that may come from eating other animals or animal byproducts.</p>\n<p>At Chino Valley Ranchers, our hens that produce Veg-a-Fed eggs receive a complete vegetarian diet that is refined by our expert nutritionist. The specialized feed is made up of grain, vegetable seed, soybean and limestone meal. There are no fish or animal byproducts used in the feed.</p>\n<p>On top of this, Chino Valley Ranchers’ Veg-a-Fed hens are kept in community barns – not in cages. They are allowed to roam freely in the space, where they can walk around while scratching and pecking at the ground to their hearts’ delight. There is plenty of natural sun coming into these barns as well. This keeps the hens happy and stress-free, which means healthier eggs are laid.</p>\n<p>Chino Valley Ranchers also offers a version of our Veg-a-Fed Cage Free eggs with Omega-3. The hens that lay these eggs have an all-vegetarian diet rich in flax seed. It is a grain that is naturally high in Omega-3 fatty acids. Researchers have shown that Omega-3 fatty acids can possibly lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes by reducing clogged arteries.</p>\n<p>When buying eggs, make sure you understand the differences between the types of eggs available to you.
