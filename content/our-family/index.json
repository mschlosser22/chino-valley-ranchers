Charles Burton Nichols worked out an arrangement with Southern California farmers to sell their fresh eggs to local grocery stores. Using the family truck for deliveries, that's how we started."

Charles, wife Isabella and their three sons, David, Steve and Charles Jr, worked hard and used innovative methods to provide better care for their birds. One of these was taking the chickens out of their cages and placing nests directly on the floor, allowing the birds to walk around on their own."

In these challenging times for our environment, doing what we can to preserve our planet has never been more important.  \n \n As a company, we take steps in a number of areas to help reduce our carbon footprint, including: \n ## Solar Panels and Turbines \n Our processing plant is powered by the sun! Rooftop solar and parking lot carport solar arrays are the source of nearly all of the power we use at our headquarters. The rest is provided by natural gas powered turbines. Our turbines provide a nearly zero emission solution in place of coal powered generation plants. \n ## Packaging Material  \n All of our egg cartons are made from recycled materials and only soy-based inks are used.  We use a variety of packaging items—labels, cartons, corrugated boxes and plastic containers—and they’re all recyclable.  \n ## Water Recycling  \n We recycle the treated water from our processing to provide all of the irrigation water for our landscaping at our headquarters.  \n ## Sustainable Forestry Initiative  \n All of our liquid egg cartons bear the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) symbol, which certifies the paper materials are sourced through responsible and sustainable management of North American forests.  \n ## Composting  \n We take the manure from our chickens, mix it with green waste from our farms and create a beautiful thing: fertilizer.  Then it goes directly to organic farms in neighboring communities.  Also noteworthy: all of the paper-based egg cartons we use are compostable.",
