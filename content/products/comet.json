        "What makes Comet Eggs such a striking shade of intergalactic orange? It’s not JUST that they are produced closer to the sun.",
        "The answer is carotenoids. Carotenoids may rhyme with asteroids, but they are actually naturally occurring yellow-orange pigments found right here on Earth. (Think carrots and sea kelp.) The carotenoids beta carotene, lutein and xanthophyll (found in our egg yolks) are all linked to eye health. Studies reveal that beta carotene also improves cognitive function.",
        "The presence of these natural wonders make Comet Eggs the blazing sun on your breakfast plate and the universally superior choice for your family table. (And ensure that our super-smart chickens don’t need eye glasses.)",
