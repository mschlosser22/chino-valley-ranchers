We also own and operate Southern California’s only certified organic feed mill for poultry for complete quality control.  \n ### CAGE FREE MEANS HAPPIER CHICKENS  \n We know the impact an environment has on a chicken’s life and believe that happy hens are productive hens. Given the pleasant weather conditions in California, our chickens have the opportunity to live active lives thanks to plenty of time outdoors with fresh air and sunlight. All of our birds have access to soil and vegetation where they can dust bathe, scratch, and dig for insects.  \n Our chickens lay their eggs inside within the floor operations where they can roam around the building, room and, open area, usually inside a barn or poultry house. They always have unlimited access to fresh food and water. Sometimes, they choose to forage for food outdoors.  \n ### IT’S SIMPLE. THEY GET TO DO WHAT CHICKENS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.",
